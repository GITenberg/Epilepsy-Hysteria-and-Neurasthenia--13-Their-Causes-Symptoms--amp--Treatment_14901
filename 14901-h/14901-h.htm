<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>I hope this book will meet a real need, for when one considers how
  prevalent epilepsy, hysteria and neurasthenia are, among all ranks and
  ages of both sexes, it seems remarkable some such popular book was not
  written long ago.</p>

  <p>I add nothing to our knowledge of these ills, my object being to put
  what we know into simple words, and to insist on the necessity for
  personal discipline being allied to expert aid. The book aims at helping,
  not ousting, the doctor, who may find it of use in getting his patient to
  see&mdash;and to act on&mdash;the obvious.</p>

  <p>"Nervous Disease", as here used, includes only the three diseases
  treated of; "Neuropath"&mdash;victims of them.</p>

  <p>"Advice" to a neuropath is usually a very depressing decalogue of
  "Thou Shalt Nots!" If it be made clear <i>why</i> he must <i>not</i> do
  so-and-so, the patient endeavours to obey; peremptorily ordered to obey,
  he rebels. Much sound advice is wasted for lack of an interesting,
  convincing, "Reason Why!" which would ensure the hearty and very helpful
  co-operation of a patient who had been taught that writing prescriptions
  is not the limit of a doctor's activities.</p>

  <p>Many folk, with touching belief in his own claims, regard the quack as
  a hoary-headed sage, who from disinterested motives devotes his life to
  curing ailments, by methods of which he alone has the secret, at low
  fees. To fight this dangerous idea I have tried to <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>[x]</span> show in an interesting way
  how science deals with nerve ills, and to prove that qualified aid is
  needed. Suggestions and criticisms will be welcomed.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Epilepsy, or "Falling Sickness", is a chronic abnormality of the
  nervous system, evinced by attacks of <i>alteration of consciousness</i>,
  usually accompanied by convulsions.</p>

  <p>It attacks men of every race, as well as domesticated animals, and has
  been known since the earliest times, the ancients imputing it to demons,
  the anger of the gods, or a blow from a star.</p>

  <p>It often attacks men in crowds, when excited by <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span> oratory or sport, hence
  the Roman name: <i>morbus comitialis</i> (crowd sickness).</p>

  <p>In mediæval times, sufferers were regarded with awe, as being
  possessed by a spirit. Witch doctors among savages, and founders and
  expounders of differing creeds among more civilized peoples, have taken
  advantage of this infirmity to claim divine inspiration, and the power of
  "seeing visions" and prophesying.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy has always interested medical men because of its frequency,
  the difficulty of tracing its cause, and its obstinacy to treatment,
  while it has appealed to popular imagination by the appalling picture of
  bodily overthrow it presents, so that many gross superstitions have grown
  up around it.</p>

  <p>The description in Mark ix. 17-29, is interesting:</p>

  <blockquote>"Master, I have brought Thee my son, which hath a dumb
  spirit. And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
  and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: ... straightway the spirit
  tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"And He asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
  unto him? And he said, Of a child. And ofttimes it hath cast him into the
  fire, and into the waters, to destroy him.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
  but by prayer and fasting."</blockquote>

  <p>Up to the present, epilepsy can be ascribed to no specific disease of
  the brain, the symptoms being due to some morbid disturbance in its
  action. Epilepsy is a "functional" disease.</p>

<p class="center">GRAND MAL ("<i>Great Evil</i>")</p>

  <p>An unusual feeling called an <i>aura</i> (Latin&mdash;vapour),
  sometimes warns a patient of an impending fit, <!-- Page 3 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span> commonly lasting long
  enough to permit him to sit or lie down. This is followed by giddiness, a
  roaring in the ears, or some unusual sensation, and merciful
  unconsciousness. In many cases this stage is instantaneous; in others it
  lasts some seconds&mdash;but an eternity to the sufferer. This stage is
  all that victims can recall (and this only after painful effort) of an
  attack.</p>

  <p>As unconsciousness supervenes, the patient becomes pale, and gives a
  cry, which varies from a low moan to a loud, inhuman shriek. The head and
  eyes turn to one side, or up or down, the pupils of the eyes enlarge and
  become fixed in a set stare, and the patient drops as if shot, making no
  effort to guard his fall, being often slightly and sometimes severely
  injured.</p>

  <p>The whole body then becomes stiff. The hands are clenched, with thumbs
  inside the palms, the legs are extended, the arms stiffly bent, and the
  head thrown back, or twisted to one side. The muscles of the chest and
  heart are impeded in their action, breathing ceases, the heart is slowed,
  and the face becomes pale, and then a livid, dusky blue.</p>

  <p>The skin is cold and clammy, the eyebrows knit; the tongue may be
  protruded, and bitten between the teeth. The eyeballs seem starting from
  their sockets, the eyes are fixed or turned up, so that only the
  sclerotic ("whites") can be seen, and they may be touched or pressed
  without causing blinking. The stomach, bladder, and bowels may
  involuntarily be emptied.</p>

  <p>This <i>tonic</i> stage only lasts a few seconds, and is followed by
  convulsions. The head turns from side to side, the jaws snap, the eyes
  roll, saliva and blood mingle as foam on the lips, the face is contorted
  in frightful grimaces, the arms and legs are twisted and jerked about,
  the breathing is deep and irregular, the whole body writhes violently,
  and is bathed in sweat.</p>

<!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

  <p>The spasms become gradually less severe, and finally cease. Deep
  breathing continues for some seconds; then the victim becomes
  semi-conscious, looks around bewildered, and sinks into coma or deep
  sleep.</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"...As one that falls,</p>
      <p>He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd</p>
      <p>To earth, and through obstruction fettering up</p>
      <p>In chains invisible the powers of Man;</p>
      <p>Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around</p>
      <p>Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony</p>
      <p>He hath indured, and, wildly staring, sighs:</p>
      <p>..."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a few hours he wakes, with headache and mental confusion, not
  knowing he has been ill until told, and having no recollection of events
  just preceding the seizure, until reminded of them when they are slowly,
  and with painful effort, brought to mind. He is exhausted, and often
  vomits. In severe cases he may be deaf, dumb, blind, or paralysed for
  some hours, while purple spots (the result of internal hemorrhage) may
  appear on the head and neck. Victims often pass large quantities of
  colourless urine after an attack, and, as a rule, are quite well again
  within twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>This is the usual type, but seizures vary in different patients, and
  in the same sufferer at different times. The cry and the biting of the
  tongue may be absent, the first spasm brief, and the convulsions mild.
  Epilepsy of all kinds is characterized by an <i>alteration</i> (not
  necessarily a <i>loss</i>) of consciousness, followed by loss of memory
  for events that occurred during the time that alteration of consciousness
  lasted.</p>

  <p>Attacks may occur by day only, by day and by night, or by night only,
  though in so-called nocturnal epilepsy, it is <i>sleep</i> and not night
  that induces the fit, for night-workers have fits when they go to sleep
  during the day.</p>

<!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>

  <p>Victims of nocturnal epilepsy may not be awakened by the seizure, but
  pass into deeper sleep. Intermittent wetting of the bed, occasional
  temporary mental stupor in the morning, irritability, temporary but
  well-marked lapses of memory, sleep-walking, and causeless outbursts of
  ungovernable temper all suggest nocturnal epilepsy.</p>

  <p>Such a victim awakes confused, but imputes his mental sluggishness to
  a hearty supper or "a bad night". A swollen tongue, blood-stained pillow,
  and urinated bed arouse suspicion as to the real cause, suspicion which
  is confirmed by a seizure during the day. He is more fortunate (if such a
  term can rightly be used of any sufferer from this malady) than his
  fellow victim whose attacks occur during the day, often under
  circumstances which, to a sensitive nature, are very mortifying.</p>

  <p>Epileptic attacks are of every degree of violence, varying from a
  moment's unconsciousness, from which the patient recovers so quickly that
  he cannot be convinced he has been ill, to that awful state which
  terrifies every beholder, and seems to menace the hapless victim with
  instant death. Every degree of frequency, too, is known, from one attack
  in a lifetime, down through one in a year, a month, a week, or a day;
  several in the same periods, to <i>hundreds</i> in four-and-twenty
  hours.</p>

<p class="center">PETIT MAL ("<i>Little Evil</i>")</p>

  <p>This is incomplete <i>grand mal</i>, the starting stages only of a
  fit, recovery occurring before convulsions.</p>

  <p><i>Petit mal</i> often occurs in people who do not suffer from
  <i>grand mal</i>, the symptoms consisting of a loss of consciousness for
  <i>a few seconds</i>, the seizure being so brief that the victim never
  realizes he has been unconscious. <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> He suddenly stops what he is doing, turns
  pale, and his eyes become fixed in a glassy stare. He may give a slight
  jerk, sway, and make some slight sound, smack his lips, try to speak, or
  moan. He recovers with a start, and is confused, the attack usually being
  over ere he has had time to fall.</p>

  <p>If talking when attacked, he hesitates, stares in an absent-minded
  manner, and then completes his interrupted sentence, unaware that he has
  acted strangely. Whatever act he is engaged in is interrupted for a
  second or two, and then resumed.</p>

  <p>A mild type of <i>petit mal</i> consists of a temporary
  <i>blurring</i> of consciousness, with muscular weakness. The victim
  drops what he is holding, and is conscious of a strange, extremely
  unpleasant sensation, a sensation which he is usually quite unable to
  describe to anyone else. The view in front is clear, he understands what
  it is&mdash;a house here, a tree there, and so on&mdash;yet he does not
  <i>grasp</i> the vista as usual. Other victims have short spells of
  giddiness, while some are unable to realize "where they are" for a few
  moments.</p>

  <p>Frequent <i>petit mal</i> impairs the intellect more than <i>grand
  mal</i>, for convulsions calm the patient as a good cry calms hysterical
  people. After a number of attacks of <i>petit mal, grand mal</i> usually
  supervenes, and most epileptics suffer from attacks of both types. Some
  precocious, perverse children are victims of unrecognized <i>petit
  mal</i>, and when pushed at school run grave risks of developing symptoms
  of true epilepsy. The "Little Evil" is a serious complaint.</p>

<h3>RARER TYPES OF EPILEPSY</h3>

  <blockquote>If it be true that: "One half the world does not know how the
  other half lives", how true also is it that one half the world does not
  know, and does not care, what the other half suffers.</blockquote>

  <p>Epilepsy shows every gradation, from symptoms which cannot be
  described in language, to severe <i>grand mal</i>. Gowers says: "The
  elements of an epileptic attack may be extended, and thereby be made less
  intense, though not less distressing. If we conceive a minor attack that
  is extended, and its elements protracted, with no loss of consciousness,
  it would be so different that its epileptic nature would not be
  suspected. Swiftness is an essential element of ordinary epilepsy, but
  this does not prevent the possibility of deliberation."</p>

  <p>In <b>Serial Epilepsy</b>, a number of attacks of <i>grand mal</i>
  follow one another, with but very brief intervals between. Serial
  epilepsy often ends in</p>

  <p><i>Status Epilepticus</i>, in which a series of <i>grand mal</i>
  attacks follow one another with no conscious interval. The temperature
  rises slowly, the pulse becomes rapid and feeble, the breathing rapid,
  shallow and irregular, and death usually occurs from exhaustion or
  heart-failure. Though not invariably fatal, the condition is so very
  grave that a doctor must instantly be summoned. Nearly all victims of
  severe, confirmed epilepsy (25 per cent of all epileptics) die in
  <i>status epilepticus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Jacksonian Epilepsy</b>, named after Hughlings Jackson, <!-- Page 8
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> who in 1861
  traced its symptoms to their cause, is not a true epilepsy, being due to
  a local irritation of the cortex (the outermost layer) of the brain.</p>

  <p>There is usually an <i>aura</i> before the attack, often a tingling or
  stabbing pain. The chief symptoms are convulsions of certain limbs or
  areas of the body, which, save in very severe cases, are confined to one
  side, and are not attended by loss of consciousness.</p>

  <p>The irritation spreads to adjacent areas, as wavelets spread from a
  stone thrown into a pond, with the result that convulsions of other limbs
  follow in sequence, all confined to one side.</p>

  <p>As every part of the brain is connected to every other part by
  "association fibres", in very violent attacks of Jacksonian epilepsy the
  irritation spreads to the other side of the brain also, consciousness is
  lost, the convulsions become general and bilateral, and the patient
  presents exactly the same picture as if the attack were due to <i>grand
  mal</i>.</p>

  <p>All degrees of violence are seen. The convulsions may consist only of
  a rapid trembling, or the limb or limbs may be flung about like a
  flail.</p>

  <p>Jackson said: "The convulsion is a brutal development of a man's own
  movements, a sudden and excessive contention of many of the patient's
  familiar motions, like winking, speaking, singing, moving, etc." These
  acts are learned after many attempts, and leave a memory in certain
  groups of brain cells; irritate those cells, and the memorized acts are
  performed with convulsive violence.</p>

  <p>The convulsions are followed by temporary paralysis of the involved
  muscles, but power finally returns. As we should expect, this paralysis
  lasts longest in the muscles first involved, and is slightest in the
  muscles whose brain-centres were irritated by the nearly exhausted waves.
  If the disease be untreated, the <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span> muscles in time may become totally
  paralysed, wasted, and useless.</p>

  <p>Friends should very carefully note exactly where and how the attack
  begins, the exact part first involved, and the precise order in which the
  spasms appear, as this is the only way the doctor can localize the brain
  injury. The importance of this cannot be overrated.</p>

  <p>The consulting surgeon will say if operation is, or is not, advisable,
  but <i>operation is the sole remedy for Jacksonian epilepsy</i>, for the
  causes that underly its symptoms cannot be reached by medicines.</p>

  <p>Patients must consult a good surgeon; other courses are
  <i>useless</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Psychic or Mental Epilepsy</b> is a trance-state often occurring
  after attacks of <i>grand</i> or <i>petit mal</i>, in which the patient
  performs unusual acts. The epileptic feature is the patient's inability
  to recall these actions. The complaint is fortunately rare.</p>

  <p>The face is usually pale, the eyes staring, and there may be a "dream
  state". Without warning, the victim performs certain actions.</p>

  <p>These may be automatic, and not seriously embarrassing&mdash;he may
  tug his beard, scratch his head, hide things, enter into engagements,
  find the presence of others annoying and hide himself, or take a long
  journey. Such a journey is often reported in the papers as a "mysterious
  disappearance". Yet, had he committed a crime during this time, he would
  probably have been held "fully responsible" and sentenced.</p>

  <p>The actions may be more embarrassing: breaking something, causing
  pain, exhibiting the sexual organs; the patient may be transported by
  violent rage, and abuse relatives, friends or even perfect strangers; he
  may spit carelessly, or undress himself&mdash;possibly with a vague idea
  that he is unwell, and would be better in bed.</p>

<!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>

  <p>Finally the acts may be criminal: sexual or other assault, murder,
  arson, theft, or suicide.</p>

  <p>In this state, the patient is dazed, and though he appreciates to some
  extent his surroundings, and may be able to answer questions more or less
  rationally, he is really in a profound reverie. The attack soon ends with
  exhaustion; the victim falls asleep, and a few moments later wakes,
  ignorant of having done or said anything peculiar.</p>

  <p>We usually think of our <i>mind</i> as the aggregate of the various
  emotions of which we are actually <i>conscious</i>, when, in reality,
  consciousness forms but a small portion of our mentality, the
  <i>subconscious</i>&mdash;which is composed of all our past experiences
  filed away below consciousness&mdash;directing every thought and act.
  Inconceivably delicate and intricate mind-machinery directs us, and our
  idlest fancy arises, <i>not by chance</i> as most people surmise, but
  through endless associations of subconscious mental processes, which can
  often be laid bare by skilful psycho-analysis.</p>

  <p>Our subconscious mind does not let the past jar with the present, for
  life would be made bitter by the eternal vivid recollection of incidents
  best forgotten. Every set of ideas, as it is done with, is locked up
  separately in the dungeons of subconsciousness, and these imprisoned
  ideas form the basis of memory. <i>Nothing is ever forgotten</i>, though
  we may never again "remember" it this side the grave.</p>

  <p>In a few cases we can unlock the cell-door and release the
  prisoner&mdash;we "remember"; in some, we mislay the key for awhile; in
  many, the wards of the lock have rusted, and we cannot open the door
  although we have the key&mdash;we "forget"; finally, our prisoner may
  pick the lock, and make us attend to him whether we wish to or
  not&mdash;something "strikes us".</p>

  <p>Normally, only one set of ideas (a complex) can hold <!-- Page 11
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> the stage of
  consciousness at any one time. When two sets get on the boards together,
  double-consciousness occurs, but even then they cannot try to shout each
  other down; one set plays "leading lady", the other set the "chorus
  belle" and so life is rendered bearable.</p>

  <p>This "dissociation of consciousness" occurs in all of us. A skilled
  pianist plays a piece "automatically" while talking to a friend; we often
  read a book and think of other things at the same time: our full
  attention is devoted to neither action; neither is done perfectly, yet
  both are done sufficiently well to escape comment.</p>

  <p>Day-dreaming is dissociation carried further. "Leading lady" and
  "chorus belle" change places for a while&mdash;imaginary success keeps us
  from worrying about real failure. Dissociation, day-dreaming, and mental
  epilepsy are but few of the many milestones on a road, the end of which
  is insanity, or complete and permanent dissociation, instead of the
  partial and fleeting dissociation from which we all suffer. The lunatic
  never "comes to", but in a world of dreams dissociates himself forever
  from realities he is not mentally strong enough to face.</p>

  <p>The writing of "spirits" through a "medium" is an example of
  dissociation, and though shown at its best in neuropaths, is common
  enough in normal men, as can be proved by anyone with a planchette and
  some patience.</p>

  <p>If the experimenter puts his hands on the toy, and a friend talks to
  him, while another whispers questions, he may write more or less coherent
  answers, though all the time he goes on talking, and does not know what
  his hand is writing. His mind is split into two smaller minds, each
  ignorant of the other, each busily liberating memory-prisoners from its
  own block of cells in the gaol of the subconscious. The writing often
  refers <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[pg
  12]</span> to long-forgotten incidents, the experiment sometimes being of
  real use in cases of lost memory.</p>

  <p>Dreams are dissociations in sleep, while the scenes conjured up by
  crystal-gazing are only waking dreams, in which the dissociation is
  caused by gazing at a bright surface and so tiring the brain centres,
  whereupon impressions of past life emerge from the subconscious, to
  surprise, not only the onlookers to whom they are related, but also the
  gazer herself, who has long "forgotten them".</p>

  <p>It is childish to attach supernatural significance to either dreams or
  crystal-gazing, both of which mirror, not the future, but only the past,
  the subject's own past.</p>

  <p>It is noteworthy that women dream more frequently and vividly than
  men. When a dreamer has few worries, he usually dreams but forgets his
  dream on waking; when greatly worried, he often carries his problems to
  bed with him, and recent "representative dreams" are merely unprofitable
  overtime work done by the brain. Occasionally, dreams have a purely
  physical basis as when palpitation becomes transformed in a dream into a
  scene wherein a horse is struggling violently, or where an uncovered foot
  originates a dream of polar-exploration; in this latter type the dream is
  protective, in that it is an effort to side-track some irritation without
  breaking sleep.</p>

  <p>Since Freud has traced a sex-basis in all our dreams, many worthy
  people have been much worried about the things they see or do in dreams.
  Let them remember that virtue is not an inability to conceive of
  misconduct, so much as the determination to refrain from it, and it may
  well be that the centres which so determinedly inhibit sexual or unsocial
  thoughts in the day, are tired by the very vigour of their resistance,
  and so in sleep allow the thoughts they have so stoutly opposed when
  waking to slip by. The man who is long-suffering and slow to wrath when
  awake, may <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[pg
  13]</span> surely be excused if he murders a few of his tormentors during
  sleep.</p>

  <p><b>Epileptiform Seizures</b> are convulsions due to causes other than
  epilepsy, and only a doctor can tell if an attack be epileptic or not and
  prescribe appropriate treatment. To give "patent" medicines for "fits",
  to a man who may be suffering from lead poisoning or heart disease, is
  criminal.</p>

  <p><b>Convulsions in Children</b> often occur before or after some other
  ailment. Such children need careful training, but less than 10 per cent
  of children who have convulsions become epileptic. Epilepsy should only
  be suspected if the first attack occurs in a previously healthy child of
  over two years of age. There are many possible causes for infantile
  convulsions, and but one treatment; call in a doctor <i>at once</i>, and,
  while waiting for him, put the child in a warm bath (not over 100° F.) in
  a quiet, darkened room, and hold a sponge wrung out of hot water to the
  throat at intervals of five minutes. Never give "soothing syrups" or
  "teething powders".</p>

  <p>The "soothing" portion of such preparations is some essential oil,
  like aniseed, caraway or dill, and there are often present strong drugs
  unsuitable for children. According to the analyses made by the British
  Medical Association, the following are the <i>essential</i> ingredients
  of some well-known preparations for children:</p>

  <p><b>Feigned Epilepsy</b> is an all-too-common "ailment". The false fit,
  as a rule, is very much overdone. The face is red from exertion instead
  of livid from heart and lung embarrassment, the spasms are too vigorous
  but not jerky enough, the skin is hot and dry instead of hot and clammy,
  the hands may be clenched, but the thumb will be <i>outside</i> instead
  of <i>inside</i> the palm, foam comes in volumes but is unmixed with
  blood, and the whole thing is kept up far too long. Almost before a crowd
  can gather an epileptic seizure is over, whereas the sham sufferer does
  not begin seriously to exhibit his questionable talents until a crowd has
  appeared.</p>

  <p>Pressure on the eye, which will blink while the "sufferer" will swear;
  bending back the thumb and pressing in the end of the nail, when the hand
  will be withdrawn in feigned but not in true epilepsy; blowing snuff up
  the nose, which induces sneezing in the sham fit alone, or using a cold
  douche will all expose the miserable trick.</p>

  <p>It is, unfortunately, far easier to suggest than to apply these tests,
  for anyone foolish enough to try experiments within reach of the
  wildly-waving arms will probably get such a buffet as will damp his
  ardour for amateur diagnosis for some time.</p>

  </table>

  <p>The majority of victims have attacks both by day and by night. Of
  115,000 seizures tabulated by Clark, 55,000 occurred during the day (6
  a.m. to 6 p.m.) and 60,000 by night.</p>

  <p>The <i>usual course</i> of a case of epilepsy is somewhat as follows:
  the disease begins in childhood, the first convulsion, about the age of
  three, being followed some twelve months later by a second, and this
  again by a third within a few months. Then attacks occur more frequently
  until a regular periodicity&mdash;from one a day to one a year&mdash;is
  reached after about five years, and this frequently persists throughout
  life.</p>

<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

  <p>The effect of epilepsy on the general health is not serious, but it
  has a more serious effect on the mind, for epileptic children cannot go
  to school (though special schools are now doing something towards
  removing this serious disability), and grow up with an imperfect mental
  training. They become moody, fretful, ill-tempered, unmanageable, and at
  puberty fall victims to self-abuse, which helps to lead to neurasthenia.
  Then they may drift slowly into a state of mental weakness, and often
  require as much care as imbeciles. If the fits are severe from an early
  age, arrest of mental development and imbecility follow. If the disease
  be very mild in character, and especially if it be <i>petit mal</i>, the
  victim may be very precocious, get "pushed" at school, and later become
  eccentric or insane.</p>

  <p>Adult victims necessarily lead a semi-invalid life, often cut off from
  wholesome work and from the pleasures of life, and become hypersensitive,
  timid, impulsive, forgetful, irritable, incapable of concentration,
  suspicious, show evidences of a weakened mind, have few interests, and
  are difficult to manage.</p>

  <p>About 10 per cent&mdash;the very severe cases&mdash;go on to insanity;
  either temporary attacks of mania, calling for restraint, or permanent
  epileptic dementia with progressive loss of mind. Some victims are
  accidentally killed in, or die as a result of a fit; about 25 per
  cent&mdash;severe cases again&mdash;die in <i>status epilepticus</i>, but
  the majority after being sufferers throughout life are finally carried
  off by some other disease.</p>

  <p>There are many exceptions to this general course. Some patients have
  attacks very infrequently, and are possessed of brilliant talent, though
  apt to be eccentric. Others may have a number of seizures in youth, and
  then "outgrow" the complaint.</p>

  <p>A few victims are attacked only after excessive alcoholic or sexual
  indulgence, some women only during <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> their menses, while
  other women are free from attacks during pregnancy, which state, however
  (contrary to popular belief), commonly aggravates the trouble. Victims
  may be free from attacks during the duration of, and for some time after,
  an infectious disease; while Spratling says that a consumptive epileptic
  may have no fits for months, or even years.</p>

  <p>Some epileptics are normal in appearance, but many show signs of
  degeneration. This is common in the insane, but less frequent and
  pronounced in neurasthenics. An abnormal shape of the head or curvature
  of the skull, a high, arched palate, peculiarly-shaped ears, unusually
  large hands and feet, irregular teeth from narrow jaws, a small mouth,
  unequal length and size of the limbs, a projecting occiput, and poor
  physical development may be noted.</p>

  <p>These are most pronounced in intractable cases, in whom mental
  peculiarities are most frequently seen&mdash;either dullness, stupidity
  and ungovernable temper, or very marked talent in one direction with as
  marked an incapacity in others. In all epileptics, the pupils of the eye
  are larger than normal, and, after contracting to bright light soon
  enlarge again.</p>

  <p>The facial expression of most epileptics indicates abnormal mentality.
  When the seizures have been so frequent and severe as to cause mental
  decay, the actions are awkward, and the gait slouching and irregular.
  Progressive poor memory is one of the first signs of intellectual damage
  consequent upon severe epilepsy.</p>

  <p>Though the disease may occur at any age, most cases occur before the
  age of twenty, there being good reason to look for other causes (often
  syphilis) in cases which occur after that age. Of 1,450 of Gowers' cases,
  30 per cent commenced before the age of ten; 75 per cent before twenty.
  In Starr's 2,000 cases, 68 per cent commenced before the patient was
  twenty-one.</p>

<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>

  <p>According to Turner, the first epoch is from birth to the age of six,
  during which 25 per cent of all cases commence, usually associated with
  mental backwardness, and some due to organic brain trouble. The second
  epoch is ten to twenty-two, the time of puberty and adolescence, during
  which time no less than 54 per cent of all cases commence. This is,
  <i>par excellence</i>, the age of onset of genuine epilepsy, the mean age
  of maximum onset being fourteen in men and sixteen in women. The
  remaining 21 per cent of cases occur after the age of twenty-two.</p>

  <p>In 430 cases of epilepsy in children, Osler found that 230 were
  attacked before they reached the age of five, 100 between five and ten,
  and 100 between ten and fifteen.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy, then, is a disease of early youth, coming on when the
  development and growth of the nervous and reproductive systems is taking
  place. During this period, causes, insignificant for stable people, may
  light up the disease in those of unstable, nervous constitution, a fact
  which explains the importance of training the child.</p>

  <p>Both sexes are attacked. If we consider only cases of true idiopathic
  epilepsy female patients are probably in excess, but in epilepsy in
  adults, from all causes, males predominate. In females, the menopause may
  arrest the disease.</p>

  <p>In days gone by, epilepsy more rarely commenced after the age of
  twenty, but in these days of nerve stress it commences more frequently
  than formerly in people of mature age. A victim who has a fit for the
  first time after the age of twenty, however, should consult a nerve
  specialist immediately.</p>

  <p>In its early stages there are no changes of the brain due to, or the
  cause of, epilepsy, but in long-standing, severe cases, well-marked,
  morbid changes may be found. These are the effects, not the cause, of the
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
  disease, and they vary in intensity according to the manner of death and
  the length and severity of the malady. They probably cause the mental
  decay and slouching gait mentioned before.</p>

  <p>Fits may suddenly cease for a long time, but they usually recur, and
  most patients have them more or less regularly through life.</p>

  <p>The fact that recovery is rare should not be hidden from patients and
  friends. Perhaps 8 per cent of all classes recover&mdash;and "recovery"
  may only be a long interval&mdash;but 4 per cent of these are Jacksonian,
  syphilitic or accident cases. Only one victim in every thirty recovers
  from true epilepsy; and these are very mild cases, in which the fits are
  infrequent, there is no mental impairment, and bromides are well borne.
  The earlier the onset, the more severe and frequent the attacks, the
  deeper the coma, and the worse the mental decay, the poorer the
  outlook.</p>

  <p><i>Cure is exceptional</i>, but by vigorous treatment the severity of
  the malady may be much abated. <i>Petit mal</i> is no more hopeful than
  <i>grand mal</i>; less so in cases with severe giddiness; in all cases,
  the better the physical condition and digestive powers of the patient,
  the brighter the outlook.</p>

  <p>To sum up, epilepsy is a chronic abnormality of the higher nervous
  system, characterized by periodic attacks of alteration of consciousness,
  often accompanied by spasms of varying violence, affecting primarily the
  brain and secondarily the body, based on an abnormal readiness for action
  of the motor cells, occurring in persons with congenital nerve weakness,
  and leading to mental decay of various types and degrees of severity.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF EPILEPSY</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Find out the cause of this effect,</p>
      <p>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</p>
      <p>For this effect defective comes by cause."</p>
      <p class="i16">"Hamlet," Act II.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="center">THE MECHANISM OF THE FIT</p>

  <p>The brain consists of cells of <i>grey matter</i>, grouped together to
  form centres for thought, action or sensation, and <i>white matter</i>,
  consisting of nerve strands, which act as lines of communication between
  different parts of brain and body. The wrinkled surface (<i>cortex</i>)
  of the brain, is covered with grey matter, which dips into the fissures.
  There are also islands of grey matter embedded in the white.</p>

  <p>The front part of the brain is supposed, with some probability, to be
  the seat of intelligence, while a ribbon three inches wide stretched over
  the head from ear to ear would roughly cover the Rolandic area, in which
  are contained the <i>motor cells</i> through which impulse is translated
  to action. These motor cells are controlled by <i>inhibitory cells</i>,
  which act as brakes and release nerve energy in a gentle stream;
  otherwise our movements would be convulsive in their violence, and life
  would be impossible through inability usefully to direct our energy.</p>

  <p>That is how inhibition acts physically; mentally it is the power to
  restrain impulses until reason has suggested the wisest course.</p>

<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>

  <p>Irritation of the cortex, especially the motor area, causes
  convulsions, and experiment has shown that epilepsy may be due to a
  disease or instability of certain inhibitory cells of the cortex. The
  motor cells of epileptics are restrained, with some difficulty, by these
  cells in normal times. When irritation from any cause throws additional
  strain on the motor cells, the defective brakes fail, and the
  uncontrolled energy, instead of flowing in a gentle stream through the
  usual channels, bursts forth in a tidal wave through other areas of the
  brain, causes unconsciousness, and exhausts itself in those violent
  convulsions of the limbs which we term a fit.</p>

  <p><b>The Primary Cause</b> of epilepsy is an inherent instability of the
  nervous system.</p>

  <p><b>Secondary Causes</b> are factors which cause the first fit in a
  person with predisposing nervous instability; later, the brain gets the
  <i>fit habit</i>, and attacks recur independently of the secondary cause.
  In most cases no secondary causes can be discovered, and the disease is
  then termed <i>idiopathic</i>, for want of an explanation.</p>

  <p>Injuries to the brain may cause epilepsy, and many cases date from
  birth, a difficult labour having caused a minute injury to the brain.</p>

  <p>Some accident is often wrongly alleged as the cause of fits, for most
  victims come of a bad stock, and when the first fit occurs, their
  relatives recollect an injury or a fright in the past, which is said to
  be the cause.</p>

  <p>Great fright may cause epilepsy, as in the case of a nervous girl
  whose brother entered her room, covered with a sheet, as a "ghost", a
  "joke" that was followed by a fit within an hour.</p>

  <p>Sunstroke may cause fits, and a few cases follow infectious
  diseases.</p>

  <p>Alcoholism is a strong secondary factor, fits often <!-- Page 22
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> occurring
  during a drinking-bout and in topers, but in many cases, drunkenness,
  instead of being the cause, is only the result of a lack of self-control
  following epilepsy.</p>

  <p>Pregnancy may be a secondary cause of the malady: it may lead to more
  frequent and severe seizures in women who are already victims; bring on a
  recurrence of the malady after it has apparently been cured; or, very
  rarely, induce a temporary or permanent cure.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy may be due to abortives. These drugs wreck the constitution
  of the undesired children, who contract epilepsy from causes which would
  not so have affected them had they started fairly. In many families, the
  first child, who was wanted, is normal; some or all the others, who were
  not desired and on whom attempts were probably made to prevent birth, are
  neuropaths, as are many illegitimate children. It cannot too emphatically
  be stated that there is no drug known which will procure abortion without
  putting the woman's life in so grave a danger as to prevent medical men
  using it; legal abortion is always procured surgically. Dealing in
  abortifacients would be a capital offence under the laws of a rational
  community.</p>

  <p>Self-abuse may perhaps play some part in epilepsy commencing or
  recurring after the age of ten.</p>

  <p>The onset of menstruation often coincides with the onset of epilepsy,
  and in some cases irregularity of the menses seems to be a secondary or
  exciting cause.</p>

  <p><b>Exciting Causes</b> aggravate the trouble when present, causing
  more frequent and severe seizures. The chief are irritation of stomach
  and bowels (from decaying teeth, unchewed, unsuitable, or indigestible
  food, constipation, or diarrh&#339;a), exhaustion, work immediately after
  a meal, passion or excitement, fright, <!-- Page 23 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> worry, mental work,
  alcoholism, sexual excess, nasal growths, eye-strain; in short, anything
  that irritates brain or body.</p>

  <p><b>Theories as to Cause</b>. Epilepsy is usually classed as a
  <i>functional disorder</i>; that is, the brain cells are physically
  normal, but, for some unknown reason, they act abnormally at certain
  times. This term is a very loose one, and there is reason to believe that
  the basis of epilepsy is some obscure disease of the brain which has not
  been detected by present methods.</p>

  <p>The new school of psychologists regard the malady as a mental
  <i>complex</i>&mdash;a system of ideas strongly influenced by the
  emotions&mdash;the convulsions being but minor symptoms.</p>

  <p>Fits are most frequent between 9-10 p.m. the hours of deepest repose.
  One school says this is due to anæmia of the brain during sleep. Clark
  traces the cause to lessened inhibitory powers owing to the higher brain
  centres being at rest, while Haig claims to have explained the high
  incidence at this hour by the fact that uric acid is present in the
  system in the greatest amount at this time.</p>

  <p>Some doctors have thought, on the contrary, that <i>excess</i> of
  blood in the head was the cause, but results of treatment so directed did
  not bear out the sanguine hopes built on the theory.</p>

  <p>The fact that convulsions occur in diabetes and alcoholism, suggested
  that epilepsy was due to poisons circulating in the blood, and thus
  irritating the brain. Every act uses up cell material and leaves waste
  products, exactly as the production of steam uses up coal and leaves
  ashes. Various waste products have been found in more than normal
  quantities in the blood of epileptics, but it is uncertain whether
  accumulation of waste products causes the seizure.</p>

  <p>A convincing theory must satisfactorily account for <!-- Page 24
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> all the
  widely diverse phenomena seen in epilepsy, and the problem must remain
  largely a matter of speculation, until research work has given us a far
  deeper insight into the biochemistry of both the brain cells, and the
  germ-plasm than we have at present.</p>

<h3>PREVENTION OF ATTACKS</h3>

  <blockquote>In health matters, prevention is nine points of the
  law.</blockquote>

  <p>Some patients are obsessed by a peculiar sensation (the "aura") just
  before a fit. This warning takes many forms, the two most common being a
  "sinking" or feeling of distress in the stomach, and giddiness. The
  character of the aura is very variable&mdash;terror, excitement,
  numbness, tingling, irritability, twitching, a feeling of something
  passing up from the toes to the head, delusions of sight, smell, taste,
  or hearing (ringing, or buzzing, etc.), palpitation, throbbing in the
  head, an impulse to run or spin around&mdash;any of these may warn a
  victim that a fit is at hand. Some patients "lose themselves" and make
  curious mistakes in talking.</p>

  <p>The warning is nearly always the same each time with the same patient,
  and is more common in mild than in severe cases. Rarely, the attack does
  not go beyond this stage.</p>

  <p>When the patient becomes conscious of the aura he should sit in a
  large chair, or lie down on the floor, well away from fire, and from
  anything that can be capsized. He must never try to go upstairs to bed.
  Some one should draw the blind, as light is irritating.</p>

  <p>If the warning lasts some minutes, the patient should carry with him,
  a bottle of uncoated one-hundredth-grain tabloids of</p>

  <p><b>Nitroglycerin</b>, replacing the screw cap with a cork, so that
  they can quickly be extracted. When the <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> warning occurs,
  one&mdash;or two&mdash;should be taken, and the head bent forward. The
  arteries are dilated, the blood-pressure thus lowered, and the attack
  <i>may</i> be averted.</p>

  <p>The use of nitroglycerin is based on the theory that seizures are
  caused by anæmia due to vasomotor constriction. Success is only
  occasional, but this is so welcome as to justify the habitual use of the
  method.</p>

  <p>If the aura be brief, buy a few "pearls" of <b>Amyl Nitrite</b>, crush
  one in your handkerchief, and sniff the vapour. This has the same affect
  as nitroglycerin, but the action occurs in 15 seconds and only persists 7
  minutes. A headache occasionally follows the use of these drugs, and they
  should not be employed without professional advice.</p>

  <p>When the warning is felt in the hand or foot, a strap should be worn
  round the ankle or wrist, and pulled tight when the aura commences. This
  sometimes aborts a fit, as biting a finger in which the aura commences
  may also do.</p>

  <p>If a victim feels unwell after a meal, he must never eat the next meal
  at the usual time, simply because it <i>is</i> the usual time.</p>

  <p>Should a patient feel unwell between, say, dinner and tea, instead of
  eating his tea he must empty his bowels by an enema, or croton oil (see
  chemist), and his stomach by drinking a pint of warm water in which has
  been stirred a tablespoonful of mustard powder and a teaspoonful of salt.
  After vomiting, drink warm water.</p>

  <p><i>Never attempt to empty the stomach at the onset of a definite
  aura</i>, for if the seizure occurs, the vomit will probably obstruct the
  trachea, and suffocate the victim.</p>

  <p>After the stomach has been empty ten minutes, the patient should take
  a double dose of bromides (<a href="#page86">Chapter XIX</a>) and go to bed. Next morning he
  will be well, <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> whereas if he eats but a single piece of
  bread-and-butter he will probably have a fit within five minutes.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, in 60 per cent of cases, there is no warning at all,
  while in those cases which do exhibit an aura, the measures mentioned
  above more often fail than succeed.</p>

<h3>FIRST-AID TO VICTIMS</h3>

  <blockquote>"First-aid is the assistance which can be given in case of
  emergency by those who, with certain easily acquired knowledge are in a
  position, not only to relieve the sufferer, but also to prevent further
  mischief being done pending the arrival of a
  doctor."&mdash;Dickey.</blockquote>

  <p><i>Never try to cut short a fit</i>. Placing smelling-salts beneath
  the nose, together with all other remedies for people who have "fainted",
  are useless in epilepsy.</p>

  <p>Lay the patient on his back, with head slightly raised; admit air
  freely; remove scarf or collar and tie, unfasten waistcoat, shirt, stays
  or other tight garments, and if it be known or observed that the victim
  wears artificial teeth, remove them.</p>

  <p>If five people are at hand, let two persons grasp each a leg of the
  victim, holding it above the ankle and above the knee; two others should
  each hold a hand and the shoulder; the fifth supports the head. Do not
  kneel opposite the feet or you may receive a severe kick. Prevent the
  limbs from striking the floor, but <i>allow them full play</i>. If the
  victim rolls on his face gently turn him on his back.</p>

  <p>Roll a large handkerchief up <i>from the side</i> (not diagonally) and
  holding one end firmly, tie a knot in the other end, and place it between
  the teeth to protect the tongue; or slide the handle of a spoon or a
  piece of smooth wood between the teeth, and thus hold the tongue down.
  Soft articles like cork and indiarubber <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> should not be used,
  for if they are bitten through, the rear portion will fall down the
  throat and choke the victim.</p>

  <p>After the fit, lower the head to one side to clear any vomitus which,
  if left, might be drawn into the windpipe, lift the patient on to a
  couch, cover him warmly, and let him sleep. An epileptic's bed should be
  placed on the ground floor; if his bed be upstairs, it is difficult to
  get him there after an attack, while he may at any time fall downstairs
  and be killed.</p>

  <p>Any effort to rouse him will only make the post-epileptic stupor more
  severe, but whether he sleeps or not, he must carefully be watched, for
  patients in this state are apt to slip away, often half-clothed, and
  travel towards nowhere in particular at a wonderfully rapid rate.</p>

  <p>If several fits follow one another, or if one is very long or severe,
  send for a doctor.</p>

  <p>When a seizure occurs in public, a constable should be summoned, who,
  being a "St. John" man, will be of far more use than bystanders brimming
  over with sympathy&mdash;<i>and ignorance</i>. If some kindly householder
  near by will allow the victim to sleep for an hour or two&mdash;a boon
  usually denied more from fear of recurrence than lack of sympathy, it is
  better than taking him home. If not, let someone call a cab, and deliver
  the victim safely to his friends.</p>

  <p>Every epileptic should carry always with him a card stating his full
  name and address, with a request that some one present at any seizure
  will escort him home.</p>

  <p>If the victim wakes with a headache, give him a 10-grain
  <b>Aspirin</b> powder, or a 5-grain <b>Phenalgin</b> tablet; <i>never
  patent "cures"</i>.</p>

  <p>If possible, the patient should lie abed the day after a fit,
  undisturbed, taking only soda-and-milk and eggs beaten up in <i>hot</i>
  milk.</p>

<h3>NEURASTHENIA</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Some of your hurts you have cured,</p>
      <p class="i2">And the worst you still have survived;</p>
      <p>But what torments of mind you endured</p>
      <p class="i2">From evils which never arrived."</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Lowell.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To-day, the need to eat forces even sensible men to live&mdash;and
  die&mdash;at a feverish rate. In bygone days the world was a peaceful
  place, in which our forefathers were denied the chance of combining
  exercise with amusement dodging murderous taxis; knew not the blessings
  of "Bile Beans", nor the biliousness they blessed either; they did not
  fall victims to "advert-diseases"; and they left the waters beneath to
  the fishes, and the skies above to the birds.</p>

  <p>Withal they were sound trenchermen, who called their few ailments
  "humours" or "vapours" and knew what peace of mind meant. Sixty years ago
  there was one lunatic in every six hundred people; to-day there is one in
  every two hundred.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the "neurasthenic temperament" is not altogether a
  modern product, for Plato described it with great precision, and declared
  such people to be "undesirable citizens" for his ideal republic.</p>

  <p>Neurasthenia is due to exhaustion and poisoning of the nervous system,
  the chief symptoms of which is persistent <i>neuro-muscular fatigue with
  general irritability</i>. Its minor symptoms are almost as numerous as
  the various activities possible in mind and body.</p>

<!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>

  <p><b>The Predisposing Cause</b> of neurasthenia is inherited nervous
  instability, but among nervous diseases, neurasthenia seems the least
  dependent on heredity, this factor playing a less important part than</p>

  <p><b>Exciting Causes</b> which are the sparks that fire explosive trains
  laid by the living, and often by the dead.</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>Worry in any form (especially when accompanied by excess of brain-work),</p>
      <p>Accident-shock,</p>
      <p>Sexual abuse,</p>
      <p>Abuse of drink, drugs or tobacco,</p>
      <p>Lack of exercise,</p>
      <p>Exhausting diseases,</p>
      <p>Menopause, and diseases of the womb,</p>
      <p>"Society life",</p>
      <p>Retirement,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>are the commonest exciting causes of neurasthenia; hard brain-work,
  unless accompanied by worry, not being injurious.</p>

  <p>The disease is more common in men than women (because of the more
  active part played by them in the struggle for existence), in cities than
  in the country, in mental than in manual workers, in the "idle rich", and
  in races which live feverishly, like the Americans. It is rare in old
  age.</p>

  <p>Ambition, the race for "success", the struggle to carry out projects
  beyond the reasonable capacity of one man, and the ceaseless work and
  worry with little sleep and no real rest which mark life to-day are
  responsible for this disease.</p>

  <p>Competition has increased in all conditions of life; free course is
  given to ambition, individuals impose on their brains a work beyond their
  strength; and then comes care and perhaps reverse of fortune; and the
  nervous system, under the wear and tear of incessant excitation, at last
  becomes exhausted,</p>

<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>

  <p>The basic symptom is an inability to stand a normal amount of mental
  or physical strain, and shows itself in seven marked ways:</p>

  <p>1.  <b>Muscular Fatigue</b>, which is often most marked in the
  morning. The patient rises reluctantly, feeling as if he had not slept,
  is listless and "lazy", and can neither work nor play much without
  getting unduly tired. This weariness may pass off as the day wears
  on.</p>

  <p>2. <b>Backache</b> is often constant and annoying. It may be a pain,
  or a general discomfort, and may be felt anywhere in the back, the nape
  of the neck and down the spine being common places. The legs often "give
  way", and, in severe cases, patients believe they cannot stand, and
  become bed-ridden. Under sudden excitement they may walk again, becoming
  "miracles of healing". These <i>spinal symptoms</i> are common in
  neurasthenia following accident.</p>

  <p>3.  <b>Headache</b> is more often an abnormal sensation than an
  intense pain. Pulsations, feelings of distress, of lightness, fullness,
  heaviness and pressure are common, or a band may seem to be drawn tightly
  round the head across the forehead.</p>

  <p>The sensations are usually located in the back of the head, and may be
  accompanied by dizziness, noises in the ears, or dimness of sight. There
  may be a feeling of unsteadiness when walking, or a sense of being in
  motion when at rest. The headache varies in intensity; it is worst in the
  morning, is increased by thinking, diminished after eating, often
  improves at night, and never keeps the patient awake.</p>

  <p>4. <b>Stomach and Bowel Disorders</b>. The victim is indifferent to
  food, though dainties often tempt him, when he cannot face a square meal.
  He has a feeling of general well-being after a meal, but within an hour
  signs of imperfect digestion arise; he feels oppressed, and has
  flatulence. Later, there are flushes of heat, palpitation, drowsiness,
  and a craving for food. Constipation <!-- Page 33 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> is usually obstinate,
  while diarrh&#339;a may cause great weakness.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Sleeplessness</b>. Some patients go to sleep readily, but after
  some instants wake suddenly, in a state of excitement that persists
  despite their efforts to calm themselves, and only at an early hour in
  the morning do they sleep again. Other patients go to bed with the
  conviction they will not sleep, and are kept awake by incessant
  cogitation, their minds being harassed by a rapid flow of images, ideas
  and memories. In some cases the person is calm, his mind is at rest, yet
  he cannot sleep.</p>

  <p>6. <b>Circulatory Disturbances</b>. More blood flows to an organ at
  work than to one at rest. In health we do not notice these changes, but
  in neurasthenia these internal tides are exaggerated as rushes of blood
  to the head, flushings of various parts, and coldness of hands and
  feet.</p>

  <p>Heart palpitation is alarming but not dangerous, and the distended
  blood-vessels of the ears may set up vibrations in the drum, so that at
  night when the head is on the pillow, every beat of the heart is heard as
  a thump, which banishes sleep, and works the victim into a state of high
  tension. A pain in the chest, arms and elbows is often felt, limbs may
  swell (shown by the tightness of rings, collars, etc.) while the hands
  and feet are usually moist and clammy. The patient may have to empty the
  bladder every half-hour.  Disorders of menstruation are common.</p>

  <p>7. <b>Mental Fatigue</b>. Hundreds of pages would be needed to
  describe all the symptoms due to mental fatigue, the morbid belief that
  the victim has a fatal disease being very common, though his "disease"
  rarely makes him lie up; in the day he works, at night describes his
  symptoms to the home circle.</p>

  <p>The inability of most men to apply themselves steadfastly to any one
  set of ideas is seen in the immense <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> popularity of music
  halls, cinemas, and short-story magazines, which offer a change of
  interest every few minutes.</p>

  <p>In normal people there is a slight consciousness of mental processes,
  but the mind rarely watches itself work; the neurasthenic is unable to
  concentrate, and gets charged with inconstancy and shiftlessness.</p>

  <p>His ideas are restive, continuous thought is impossible, and when
  talking he has to be "brought back to the point" many times. Memory and
  attention flag, and he listens to a long conversation, or reads pages of
  a book without grasping its import, and consequently he readily "forgets"
  what in reality he never laboured to learn. Trembling of limbs is
  common.</p>

  <p>He lacks initiative, and whatever course he is forced to
  take&mdash;after much indecision&mdash;he is convinced, a moment later,
  it would have been wiser to have taken the opposite one.</p>

  <p>All his acts are done inattentively. He goes to his room for
  something, but has forgotten what when he gets there; later, he wonders
  if he locked the drawer, and goes back to see. At night he gets up to
  make sure he bolted the door, put out the gas, and damped the fire.</p>

  <p>Regret for the past, dissatisfaction with the present, and anxiety for
  the future are plagues common to most people, but they become acute in a
  neurasthenic, who reproaches himself with past shortcomings of no moment,
  infuriates himself over to-day's trivialities, and frets himself over
  evils yet unborn.</p>

  <p>Such a patient is often greatly upset by a trifle, yet little affected
  by a real shock, which by its very severity arouses his reactive
  faculties which lay dormant and left him at the mercy of the minor event.
  He will fret over a farthing increase in the price of a loaf, but if his
  bank fails he sets manfully to.</p>

<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

  <p>Duty that should be done to-day he leaves to be shirked to-morrow; he
  is easily discouraged, timid, and vacillating. Extremely self-conscious,
  he thinks himself the observed of all observers. If others are
  indifferent toward him, he is depressed; if interested, they have some
  deep motive; if grave, he has annoyed them; if gay, they are laughing at
  him; the truth, that they are minding their own business, never occurs to
  him, and if it did, the thought that other people were <i>not</i>
  interested in him, would only vex him.</p>

  <p>He is extremely irritable (slight noises make him start violently),
  childishly unreasonable, wants to be left alone, rejects efforts to rouse
  him, but is disappointed if such efforts be not made, broods, and fears
  insanity. The true melancholic is convinced he himself is to blame for
  his misery; it is a just punishment for some unpardonable sin, and there
  is no hope for him in this world or the next. The neurasthenic, on the
  contrary, ascribes his distress to every conceivable cause save his own
  personal hygienic errors.</p>

  <p>A neurasthenic, if epileptic, fears a fit will occur at an untoward
  moment. He dreads confined or, maybe, open spaces, or being in a crowd.
  When he reaches an open space (after walking miles through tortuous
  byways in an endeavour to avoid it) he becomes paralysed by an
  undefinable fear, and stops, or gets near to the wall.</p>

  <p>He fears trains, theatres, churches, social gatherings, or the
  office.</p>

  <p>Other victims fear knives, canals, firearms, gas, high places, and
  railway tracks, when the basic fear is of suicide. Many patients have
  sudden impulses&mdash;on which the attention is focussed with abnormal
  intensity&mdash;to perform useless, eccentric, or even criminal actions;
  to count objects, to touch lamp-posts, <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> to continually
  reiterate certain words, and so on.</p>

  <p>The victim is fully aware that there are no grounds for his panic or
  impulse, but though his reason ridicules, it cannot disperse, his fear,
  and the wretched man finds relief in sleep alone, which adds to his woes
  by being a coy lover.</p>

  <p>An almost invariable stage is that wherein the patient studies a
  patent-medicine advertisement and finds that a disease, or collection of
  diseases, is the root of his troubles. This alarms but interests him; he
  studies other advertisements, sends for pamphlets, and so becomes
  familiar with a few medical terms. He then takes a "treatment", and talks
  of his "complaint" and how he "diagnosed" it. He has become
  hypochondriac.</p>

  <p>He borrows a book on anatomy from the public library to discover in
  what part of the body his ailment is located.</p>

  <p>He draws up (or copies) a special diet-sheet, and talks of "proteids",
  notices a slight cloudiness in his urine, and underlines "The Uric-Acid
  Diathesis" in one of his pamphlets. Then his heart bumps, he diagnoses
  anew, and so goes on, usually ending by taking phosphorus for his "brain
  fag". Then he finds he has a disease unknown to the faculty, which
  discovery interests him as intensely as it irritates his unfortunate
  friends.</p>

  <p>This prince of pessimists has a conviction that, compared with him,
  Job was a happy man, and that he will go insane. He does not know that it
  is only when there are flaws in the brain from inheritance or organic
  disease that mental worry leads to lunacy; a sound brain never becomes
  unhinged from intellectual stress alone.</p>

  <p>Books and friends are daily questioned about his "diseases", and in
  spite of reassuring replies, he <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> continues to doubt, re-question and
  cross-examine endlessly, feeding his hopes on the same assurances,
  consoling himself with the same sympathies, and worrying himself with the
  same fears.</p>

  <p>Other folk may be "nervy", he is seriously ill; he <i>knows</i> it
  because he <i>feels</i> it. He expects the greatest consideration
  himself, denies it to others, and then complains he is
  "misunderstood".</p>

  <p>"Every symptom becomes magnified; the trifling ache or pain, the
  trivial flatulence, the disinclination or mere hesitation of the bowels
  to adhere to a strict schedule, all minor events such as occur to the
  majority of healthy men from time to time unheeded, come to be of vast
  importance to the psychasthenic individual."</p>

  <p>He keeps a record of hourly changes in his condition, and pesters his
  family doctor to death. He goes from physician to physician, from
  hospital to hospital. Having been induced by his friends to see a
  specialist, he bores that good man&mdash;who knows him all too
  well&mdash;with a minute description of his symptoms, presenting for
  inspection carefully preserved prescriptions, urinary examination
  records, differential blood counts, and the like. Coming away with
  precious advice, he feels he omitted to describe all his symptoms, begins
  to doubt if the specialist really understands <i>his</i> case, and so the
  pitiful farce goes on&mdash;for years.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary fact is that while he is suffering (<i>sic</i>) from
  cancer, or heart disease, or Bright's disease, and spasmodically from
  minor affections like tuberculosis, arterio-sclerosis, and liver-fluke,
  he is probably running a successful business. While making money he
  forgets his ills; the moment his attention is diverted from the "root of
  evil" he proceeds to further "diagnosis".</p>

  <p>In the end, he makes a pleasant hobby of his imaginary maladies,
  trying each patent nostrum, and <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> giving herbalists, electric-belt men,
  Christian Scientists, and dozens of other weird "specialists" a chance to
  cure him.</p>

  <p><b>Sexual Neurasthenia</b> occurs chiefly in young men given to
  self-abuse or sexual excesses. Erections and emissions are frequent,
  first at night with amorous dreams, then in the day as a result of sexual
  thoughts; weakness and pain in the back follow, and the sexual act may
  become impossible. The patient usually studies a quack advertisement, and
  passes into the hands of men who make a living by bleeding such wretches
  dry. Cold baths and the treatment outlined in <a href="#page46">Chapter IX</a> will cure
  him.</p>

  <p><b>Course and Outlook</b>. Neurasthenia is very curable. If the cause
  be removed, and vigorous treatment instituted, the victim may be well in
  a couple of months, but in most cases there are obstacles to radical
  treatment, and the disease drags on indefinitely.</p>

  <p>Egoism, moral cowardice, and sexual excess play a part in much
  neurasthenia, but relatives must not forget, in their indignation at
  these laxities, that the patient really <i>is</i> ill; it is unkind,
  unjust and useless to tell an ailing man the unpalatable truth that it is
  his own fault.</p>

<h3>HYSTERIA</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</p>
      <p>In strange eruptions; ..."</p>
      <p class="i16">"King Henry IV."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hysteria, recorded in legend and law, in manuscript and marble, in
  folk-lore and chronicle, right from history's dawn, is still a puzzle of
  personality, and only equalled by syphilis in the protean nature of its
  manifestations.</p>

  <p>The sacred books of the East said delayed menstruation due to a devil
  was its cause; the thrashing-out of the devil its cure. Chinese legends
  describe it, and its symptoms were ascribed by the Inquisition to
  witchcraft and sorcery.</p>

  <p>Old Egyptian papyri tell how to dislodge the devil from the stomach,
  and there were hysteria specialists in 450 B.C. All old theories fix on
  the womb as the seat of the disease. The name hysteria is the Greek word
  for womb, and 97 per cent of patients are women.</p>

  <p>A few of the very numerous modern theories may be noticed.</p>

  <p>The unconscious (or the subconscious) and the conscious are only parts
  of one whole. Our "conscious" activities are those which have developed
  late in the history of the race, and which develop comparatively late in
  the history of the individual. The "conscious" is the product of the
  racial education of the "unconscious"; the first is the man, the <!--
  Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
  modern, the civilized; the last is the child, the primitive, the savage.
  Between the two there is no gulf fixed, and the Oxford metaphysician need
  not go to Timbuctoo to seek a superstitious savage; he may find one
  within himself.</p>

  <p>In hysteria, Janet says, the field of consciousness is narrowed, and
  the patient lives through subconscious experiences, which she forgets
  when she again "comes to". She journeys back into the past, back a few
  years individually, back centuries or æons racially, and becomes a savage
  child again.</p>

  <p>Normally, when anything goes wrong, or we suffer from excessive
  emotion, we give vent to our feelings by tears, abuse, anger, or
  impulsive action; in some way we "hit back", and relieve ourselves of the
  feeling of oppression. Then we forget, which heals the sore, and closes
  the experience.</p>

  <p>If, at the moment, we bottle up our emotions, they obtrude later at
  inconvenient times until we "get them off our mind" by confiding in some
  one, when we get peace of mind. Open confession <i>is</i> good for the
  soul, and it is better to "cry your eyes out" than to "eat your heart
  out".</p>

  <p>There are some experiences, however, to which we cannot react by anger
  or confidence, and so we imprison our emotions, and try to obtain peace
  of mind by forgetting the irritation.</p>

  <p>Freud thinks perverted sex ideas are thus repressed, and cause
  hysteria by coming into conflict with the normal sex life. If these old
  sores can be laid bare by psycho-analysis, and the mental abscess drained
  by confession and contrition, cure follows.</p>

  <p>The biologists consider hysteria as an adult childishness, a primitive
  mode of dodging difficulties. Victims cannot live up to the complicated
  emotional standard of modern life, and so act on a standard which to us
  seems natural only in children and uncivilized races.</p>

  <p>Hysteria is a disease of youth, usually ceasing at the climacteric.
  Social, financial and domestic worries <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> are exciting causes,
  a happy marriage often curing, and an unhappy one greatly aggravating the
  complaint. It is most common among the races we usually deem "excitable",
  the Slavs, Latin races and Jews, and is often associated with anæmia and
  pelvic disorders.</p>

  <p><b>Symptoms</b>. Changeability of mood is striking. "All is caprice.
  They love without measure those they will soon hate without reason."</p>

  <p>Sensationalism is manna to them. They <i>must</i> occupy the
  limelight. Pains are magnified or manufactured to attract sympathy; they
  pose as martyrs&mdash;refusing food at table, and eating sweets in their
  room, or stealing down to the larder at night&mdash;to the same end. If
  mild measures fail, then self-mutilation, half-hearted attempts at
  suicide, and baseless accusations against others are brought into play to
  focus attention on them.</p>

  <p>Minor attacks usually commence with palpitation and a "rising" in the
  stomach or a lump in the throat, the <i>globus hystericus</i>, which the
  patient tries to dislodge by repeated swallowing. This is followed by a
  feeling of suffocation, the patient drags at her neck-band, throws
  herself into a chair, pants for breath, calls for help, and is generally
  in a state of great agitation. She may tear her hair, wring her hands,
  laugh or weep immoderately, and finally swoon. The recovery is gradual,
  is accompanied by eructations of gas, and a large quantity of pale,
  limpid, urine may be passed later.</p>

  <p>Major attacks have attracted attention through all ages, ancient
  statues showing the same poses as modern photographs. The beginning
  stage&mdash;which may last a few moments or a few days&mdash;is one of
  mental unrest, the victim being irritable and depressed. In some cases a
  warning aura then occurs; clutchings at the throat, or the <i>globus
  hystericus</i>, palpitation, dizziness, sounds in the ears, spots dancing
  before the eyes, or <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> feelings of intense "<i>tightness</i>"
  as if the skin is about to tear or the stomach to burst.</p>

  <p>The victim throws herself on a chair or couch, from which she slides
  to the floor, apparently senseless, the head being thrown back, the arms
  extended, the legs held straight and stiff. The face is that of a
  dreamer, and the crucifix position is not uncommon. This stage is a
  gigantic sexual stretch.</p>

  <p>Next comes the convulsive stage, but the convulsions are not the true
  jerky movements of epilepsy, but are bilateral tossing, kicking, and
  rolling movements, interspersed with various irregular passionate
  attitudes. There is great alteration but <i>not loss</i> of
  consciousness. The patient struggles with those about her, bites them,
  but never her own tongue, shrieks and fights, but never passes urine,
  throws things about, and arches the back until the body rests on head and
  feet (<i>opisthotonos</i>). The stretching and convulsive stages
  alternate, and the attack lasts a long time, being stopped by pain or by
  the departure of onlookers. During this stage the face may reflect the
  various emotions passing through the mind&mdash;with a fidelity that
  would rouse the envy of an Irving.</p>

  <p>The patient gradually calms down, and a fit of tears or a scream ends
  the attack, after which the worn-out victim is depressed but not
  confused, though memory for the events of the attack may only be partial.
  The patient sometimes passes into the "dream state", described in <a href="#page7">Chapter
  II</a>, for some hours or occasionally for far longer; these are the women
  described with much gusto in the local Press as being in a
  trance&mdash;"the living dead".</p>

  <p>The victim of these attacks <i>is</i> suffering from a disease, for
  she shows many temporary mental symptoms which could not possibly be
  feigned, while there is often a genuine partial forgetfulness of the
  incidents of an attack. She says she cannot help it; candid <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> friends say
  she will not. The truth is that she cannot <i>will</i> not to help it;
  for though intelligence and memory are often good and sometimes abnormal,
  the judgment and will are always weak&mdash;indecision, obstinacy, and
  doubt being common.</p>

  <p><b>Treatment</b>. A thorough examination by a doctor is <i>absolutely
  essential</i>, to prove that the patient is merely hysterical, and not
  the victim of unrecognized organic disease. In a few cases, skilled
  attention to some minor ailment will result in an apparently miraculous
  cure.</p>

  <p>Many who habitually "go into hysterics", are merely grown-up "spoiled
  children", and in all cases, the basic factor is a lack of control and
  self-discipline.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, these tainted individuals who are so exquisitely
  sensitive that any reproof brings floods of tears, turn with mercurial
  rapidity from passionate fury to passionate self-reproach, and assuage by
  impassioned protestations of affection the distress they have carelessly
  inflicted, and, as a consequence of their momentary but undoubtedly
  sincere contrition, escape blame and punishment.</p>

  <p>Harmful sympathy is thus substituted for helpful discipline, and the
  more stable members of the family are often made slaves to the whims and
  caprices of the hysterical member.</p>

  <p>The usual home treatment of the victim passes through various stages,
  and lacks persistence. Violent methods are succeeded by studied
  indifference; and that again by reproaches and recriminations.</p>

  <p>Greene's remarks are very pertinent: "The condition must be regarded
  as an acquired psycho-neurosis to be ameliorated, and perhaps removed, by
  suggestion and a complete control, which, though kind, is firm,
  persistent, insistent, and <i>lacking in every element that enters into
  the upbuilding of the hysterical temperament</i>."</p>

For anæmic patients, the following is a useful
prescription:

  </table>

  <p>As far as the minor symptoms are concerned, the disease is usually
  chronic, for as soon as one symptom has been overcome another takes its
  place, and there is little hope of cure save when the case is taken
  vigorously in hand in childhood, treatment being best given in a home or
  hospital. Home treatment consists in an attempt to inculcate the lost or
  never-acquired habit of self-control, and in the hygienic measures laid
  down for neuropaths in general in the rest of this book.</p>

  <p>In a major attack, <i>show no sympathy</i>. Let every one leave the
  room, save one attendant, whom the victim knows to be of firm character,
  and calm but determined disposition. This attendant should get a jug of
  water, and threaten to douche the victim unless she makes vigorous
  efforts to control herself. If she cannot, or will not, <i>douche
  her</i>, then hold a towel over her nose and mouth, and she will perforce
  cease her gymnastics to breathe, though the attendant must be prepared
  for an outburst of abuse when she has recovered her breath. Between
  attacks, all who are brought into contact with the victim, must adopt a
  tolerant but unsympathetic attitude, while efforts are made to inculcate
  habits of control.</p>

<h3>ADVICE TO NEUROPATHS</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Great temperance, open air,</p>
      <p>Easy labour, little care."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The above quotation epitomizes the cure for neurasthenia, for as
  Huxley said:</p>

  <blockquote>"Our life, fortune, and happiness depend on our knowing
  something of the rules of a game far more complicated than chess, which
  has been played since Creation; every man, woman and child of us being
  one of the players in a game of our own. The board is the world, the
  pieces the phenomena of the universe, while the rules of the game are the
  laws of nature. Though our opponent is hidden, we know his play is fair,
  just and patient, but we also know to our sorrow that he never overlooks
  a mistake or makes the slightest allowance for ignorance. To the man who
  plays well, the highest stakes are paid with that overflowing generosity
  with which the strong show their delight in strength. The one who plays
  badly is checkmated; without haste, but without remorse. Ignorance is
  visited as sharply a as wilful disobedience; incapacity meets with the
  same punishment as crime."</blockquote>

  <p>In many cases some real trouble is the best medicine for a
  neurasthenic, for though disaster may crush him, it is more likely to act
  as a spur, by diverting his thoughts from his woes, and making him fight
  instead of fret.</p>

<!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>

  <p>Since such blessings in disguise cannot be booked to order, first see
  a doctor. Though little be physically wrong, the sense of comfort and
  relief from fear, which a clear idea of what <i>is</i> wrong brings, goes
  a long way towards cure by giving the patient hope and confidence.</p>

  <p>Having seen the doctor, assist him by carrying out the following
  advice as far as real limitations&mdash;not lazy
  inclinations&mdash;permit. Do not say after reading this chapter, "I know
  all that"; you have to <i>do</i> "all that", for medicine alone, whether
  patent or prescribed, is useless.</p>

<hr />

  <p>Go for a long sea voyage, if possible.</p>

  <p>If not, get a long holiday in a quiet farmhouse, or, better still, get
  to the country for good, be it in never so humble a capacity, for a
  healthy cowman is happier than a neurasthenic clerk. The rural worker has
  no theatres, but he can walk miles without meeting another; he has woods
  to roam in, hills to climb, trees to muse under: he has ample light and
  air, and his is a far happier lot than that of a vainglorious but
  miserable, sedentary machine in a great city.</p>

  <p>The rural districts round Braemar, the Channel Islands, Cromer, Deal,
  Droitwich, Scarborough, and Weston-super-Mare are, in general, suitable
  holiday resorts for neuropaths.</p>

  <p>Avoid alcohol, tea, coffee, much meat, all excitement, anger and
  <i>worry</i>. Take tickets only for comedy at the theatre, and leave
  lectures, social gatherings and dances alone.</p>

  <p>Nerve-starvation needs generous feeding with easily digested food.
  Drink milk in gradually increasing amounts up to half a gallon per day.
  If more food is needed, add eggs, custard, fruit, spinach, chicken, or
  fish, but do not forgo any milk. Avoid starchy foods and sweets.</p>

<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>

  <p>Eat only what you can digest, and digest all you eat. Chew every
  mouthful a hundred times. This is one of the few sensible food fads.</p>

  <p>Drink water copiously between meals, and take no liquid (save the
  milk) with them. Keep the bowels open.</p>

  <p>If you <i>must</i> "occupy your mind", take up some very simple, quiet
  hobby. Gardening, fretwork, photography and gymnastics are not
  necessarily quiet hobbies. Chess, billiards, and contortions with
  gymnastic apparatus are not to be recommended.</p>

  <p>If you <i>must</i> read, peruse only humorous novels. Never study, and
  leave exciting fiction and medical work alone. Symptoms are the most
  misleading things in a most misleading world.</p>

  <p>After your evening meal, take a quiet walk, go to bed <i>and
  sleep</i>. You should occasionally spend from Saturday midday to Monday
  morning in bed, with blinds drawn, living on milk, seeing nobody and
  doing <i>nothing</i>. The deepest degradation of the Sabbath is to fill
  it with odd jobs which have accumulated through the week.</p>

  <p>Do not get out of bed too early in the morning, but rise in time to
  eat your breakfast slowly, attend to the toilet, and catch the car
  without haste. If your occupation be an indoor one, rise an hour earlier,
  and walk or cycle quietly to work.</p>

  <p>Take a warm bath followed by a cold douche on rising. If no warm
  after-glow follows, use tepid water. Keep your body warm; your head
  cool.</p>

  <p>Be continent. Nerve-tone and sexual delights are not compatible.
  Matrimony, while a convenient cloak, is no excuse for lust.</p>

  <p>Try suggestion for fears and impulses (see <a href="#page82">Chapter XVIII</a>), for it is
  useless to try to "reason them out", though it is useful for a brief
  period each day to try deliberately to turn the mind away from the
  obsession, <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[pg
  49]</span> by singing or whistling, gradually prolonging the
  attempts.</p>

  <p>Rest, to prevent the manufacture of more waste products, the
  elimination of those present, and the generation of nerve-strength from
  nourishing food are the things that cure. <a href="#page86">Chapters XIX</a> and <a href="#page90">XX</a> deal with
  the drug treatment.</p>

  <p><b>Do not Worry</b>. Whatever your trouble is, it is useless to</p>

  <blockquote>"Look before and after, and sigh for what is
  not"</blockquote>

  <p>for the future cannot be rushed nor the past remedied. All patients
  reply promptly that they "can't help" worrying, when in truth they do not
  try.</p>

  <p>Work never hurt anyone, but harassing preoccupation with problems
  which no amount of thought will solve drives many thousands to early
  graves. Anger exhausts itself in a few minutes, fatigue in a few hours,
  and real overwork with a week's rest, but worry grows ever worse. Ponder
  Meredith's lines:</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"I <i>will</i> endure; I will not strive to peep</p>
      <p>Behind the barrier of the days to come."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Look on the bright side!" said an optimist to a melancholy
  friend.</p>

  <p>"But there is no bright side."</p>

  <p>"Then polish up the dull one!" was the sound advice tendered.</p>

  <p><i>Learn to forget</i>!</p>

  <p>One cannot open a periodical without being exhorted to train one's
  memory for a variety of reasons. The neuropath needs a system of
  forgetfulness. Lethe is often a greater friend than Mnemosyne.</p>

  <p>To brood on disappointments, failures and griefs <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> only wastes energy,
  sours temper, and upsets the general health. Resolve <i>beforehand</i>
  that when unhappy ideas arise you will <i>not</i> dwell on them, but turn
  your thoughts to pleasant trifles; take up a humorous book, or take a
  turn in the fresh air, and you will soon acquire the habit of laughing
  instead of whining at Fate.</p>

  <p>To sum up: Go slow! Your neurons have been exhausted in your foolish
  attempt to "live this day as if thy last" in a wrong sense; feverish
  activity and unnecessary work must be abandoned to enable the nerves to
  recuperate.</p>

  <p>When the doctor says "rest", he means "<i>rest</i>", not change your
  bustle from work to what you are pleased to regard as play.</p>

  <p>So much is <i>absolute rest</i> recognized as the foundation of
  treatment, that severe cases undergo the "Weir-Mitchell Treatment". The
  patient is <i>utterly secluded</i>; letters, reading, talking, smoking
  and visits from friends are forbidden. He is put to bed, not allowed even
  to sit up, sees no one save nurse and doctor, is massaged, treated
  electrically, grossly overfed, fattened up, and freed from every
  care.</p>

  <p>In leaving his habitual circle, the patient escapes the too-attentive
  care of his relatives, and the incessant questions about his complaint
  with which they overwhelm him. The results of this régime with
  semi-insane wrecks are marvellous. It is a very drastic but very
  successful "rest-cure", and while it cannot be undergone at home,
  neurasthenics will benefit by following its principles as far as they can
  in their own homes.</p>

  <p>High-frequency or static electricity sometimes works wonders in the
  hands of a specialist, but the electric batteries, medical coils,
  finger-rings and body-belts so persistently advertised are
  <i>useless</i>.</p>

  <p>When the patient has in some measure recuperated, <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> he may try
  the following exercises in mental concentration. Vittoz claims good
  results from them, but they must be done quite seriously.</p>

  <blockquote>1. Walk a few steps with the definite idea that you are
  putting forward right and left feet alternately. Go on by easy stages
  until you concentrate on the movement of the whole body.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>2. Take any object in your hand, and note its exact form,
  weight, colour, etc.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>3. Look in a shop-window while you count ten, and as you walk
  on, try to recall all the objects therein exhibited.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>4. Accustom yourself to defining the sounds you hear, and
  concentrating on a special one, as that of a passing tram, or a ticking
  watch.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>5. Make a rapid examination several times daily of your
  feelings and thoughts, and try to express them definitely.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>6. Concentrate on the mental reproduction of a regular curve:
  a figure 8 placed on its side.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>7. Listen to a metronome, and, a friend having stopped it,
  mentally repeat the ticking to time.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>8. Whenever you handle anything, try to retain the impression
  of that object and its properties for several minutes, to the exclusion
  of other ideas.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>9. Concentrate on ideas of calm, and of energy
  controlled.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>10. Place three objects on a sheet of white paper. Remove
  them one by one, at the same time effacing the impression of each one as
  it is removed, until the mind, like the paper, is blank.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>11. Efface two of the objects, and retain the impression of
  one only.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>12. Replace the impressions in your mind, but not the objects
  on the paper, one by one.</blockquote>

  <p>The object of these exercises is to get your wandering <!-- Page 52
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> mind daily a
  little more under control; do not exhaust yourself.</p>

  <p>After some months of treatment, ask yourself&mdash;</p>

  <p>Am I able to walk ten miles with ease? when introduced to a stranger
  of either sex or any age, to converse agreeably, profitably and without
  embarrassment? to entertain visitors so that all enjoy themselves? to
  read essays or poetry with as much pleasure as a novel? to listen to a
  lecture, and be able afterwards to rehearse the main points? to be good
  company for myself on a rainy day? to submit to insult, injustice or
  petulance with dignity and patience, and to answer them wisely and
  calmly? When you are able to answer, "Yes!" to these queries, your nerves
  are sound.</p>

<h3>FIRST STEPS TOWARDS HEALTH</h3>

  <blockquote>"All sick people want to get well, but rarely in the best
  way. A 'jolly good fellow' said: 'Strike at the root of the disease,
  Doctor!' And smash went the whisky bottle under the faithful physician's
  cane."</blockquote>

  <p>In neuropaths, all irritation to the nervous system is dangerous, and
  must be eliminated, and to this end, eyes, ears, nose and teeth, all in
  close touch with nerves and brain, must be put and kept in perfect
  order.</p>

  <p><b>The Eye</b>. Only 4 per cent, of people have <i>perfect</i> sight.
  Errors in refraction&mdash;common in neuropaths&mdash;mean that the
  unstable brain-cells are constantly irritated. Dodd corrected eye-errors
  in 52 epileptics, 36 of whom showed improvement.</p>

  <p>You take your watch to a watchmaker, not a chemist; take your eyes to
  an oculist, and if you cannot afford to see one privately, get an
  eye-hospital note. (To allow a chemist or "optician" to try lenses until
  he finds a pair through which you "see better" is very dangerous.)</p>

  <p>Then you go to a qualified optician, who makes a proper frame, and
  inserts the lenses prescribed. Patients should inquire if the glasses are
  to be worn continually, or only when doing close work or reading.</p>

  <p><b>The Ears</b>. Giddiness and other unpleasant symptoms may be due to
  ear trouble. If there is any discharge, buzzing or ringing, see a doctor,
  for if ear disease gains a firm hold it is usually incurable.</p>

<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>

  <p><b>The Nose</b>. Neuropaths often suffer from moist nasal catarrh, or
  from a dry type in which crusts of offensive mucus form, the disagreeable
  odour of which is not apparent to the patient himself. He must pay
  careful attention to the general health, take nourishing food, and wash
  out the nose three times a day with:</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>1 oz. Bicarbonate of Soda,</p>
      <p>1 oz. Common Salt,</p>
      <p>1 oz. Borax,</p>
      <p>Dissolved in 1 pint hot water.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For obstinate nasal trouble, consult an aural surgeon.</p>

  <p><b>The Teeth</b>.</p>

  <blockquote>"Most men dig their graves with their teeth."&mdash;Chinese
  Proverb.</blockquote>

  <p>Serious ills are caused by defective teeth, for microbes decompose the
  food left in the crevices to acid substances which dissolve the lime
  salts from the teeth, and this process continues until the tooth is
  lost.</p>

  <p>Faulty teeth are common in neuropaths, and at the risk of being
  wearisome&mdash;and good advice is wearisome to people&mdash;patients
  must get proper aid, privately or at a dental hospital, from a

<h3>DIGESTION</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"We may live without poetry, music and art;</p>
      <p>We may live without conscience, and live without heart;</p>
      <p>We may live without friends, we may live without books,</p>
      <p>But civilized man cannot live without cooks."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The human digestive system consists of a long tube, in which food is
  received, nutriment taken from it as it passes slowly downwards, and from
  which waste is discharged, in from sixteen to thirty hours
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>Six glands pour saliva into the mouth, where it should be&mdash;but
  how rarely is&mdash;mixed with the food, causing chemical changes, and
  moistening the bolus to pass easily down.</p>

  <p>The acid <b>Gastric Juice</b>, of which a quart is secreted daily,
  stops the action of the saliva, and commences to digest the proteins,
  which pass through several stages, each a little more assimilable than
  the last.</p>

  <p>The lower end of the stomach contracts regularly and violently,
  churning the food with the juice, and gradually squirting it, when
  liquified to <b>Chyme</b>, into the small intestine. If food is not
  chewed until almost liquified, the gastric juice cannot act normally, but
  has to attack as much of the surface of the food-lump as possible,
  leaving the interior to decompose, causing dyspepsia and flatulence.</p>

  <p>Most people suppose the stomach finishes digestion, but it only
  initiates the digestion of those foodstuffs which contain nitrogen,
  leaving fats, starches and sugars untouched.</p>

<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>

  <p>By an obscure process, the acid chyme stimulates the walls of the
  bowel to send a chemical messenger, a <b>Hormone</b> through the blood to
  the liver and pancreas, warning them their help is needed, whereupon they
  actively secrete their ferments.</p>

  <p>The secretion of the pancreas is very complex. It carries on the work
  of the saliva, and also splits insoluble fats into a soluble milky
  emulsion.</p>

  <p>Fats are unaffected in the mouth and stomach, which explains why hot,
  buttered toast, and other hot, greasy dishes are so indigestible. The
  butter on plain bread is quickly cleared off, and the bread attacked by
  the gastric juice, but in toast or fatty dishes, the fat is intimately
  mixed with other ingredients, none of which can properly be dealt with.
  Always butter toast when cold.</p>

  <p>To continue: The secretion of the pancreas also contains a very active
  ferment, which, on entering the bowel, meets and mixes with another
  ferment four times as powerful as gastric juice, which completes the
  digestion of the proteids.</p>

  <p>Meantime, the secretions of Lieberkühn's glands (of which there are
  immense numbers in the small intestine) are further aiding the digestion
  of the chyme, while the liver (the largest and most important gland in
  the body) sends its ferments, and the gall-bladder its bile, which
  further emulsifies the fatty acids and glycerin until they are ready to
  be absorbed.</p>

  <p>The chemically-changed chyme is now termed <b>Chyle</b>, and is ready
  to be absorbed by the minute, projecting <b>Villi</b>.</p>

  <p>The fatty portion of the chyle is absorbed by minute capillaries and
  ultimately mingles with the blood, which may look quite milky after a
  fatty meal.</p>

  <p>The remaining food is absorbed by the blood capillaries in the villi,
  and passes to the liver for filtration and storage.</p>

<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>

  <p>The large bowel has Lieberkühn's glands, but not villi, and is
  relatively unimportant, though most of the water the body needs is
  absorbed from here.</p>

  <p>How food becomes energy and tissue we do not know. The tissues are
  continually being built up from assimilated food, and as constantly being
  burnt away, oxygen for this purpose being extracted from the air we
  inhale, and carried via the blood to every corner of the body. The ashes
  of this burning are expelled into the blood and lymph, and carried out of
  the body by the kidneys, lungs, skin and bowels. The product of the
  burning is the marvel&mdash;<b>Life</b>; the extinction of the fire is
  the terror&mdash;<b>Death</b>.</p>

  <p>Energy is obtained almost solely from the combustion of fats and
  sugars, proteids being reconverted into albumin, and then broken down to
  obtain their carbon for combustion, the nitrogen being expelled, but
  proteids are essential for the building of the tissues themselves, the
  stones of the furnaces which burn up carbohydrates and fats.</p>

  <p>The time taken in the digestion of foods was first studied through a
  wound in the stomach of St. Martin, a Canadian. Experiments were made
  with various well-masticated foods, and with similar foods placed
  unchewed, into the stomach through the wound, the latter experiment being
  carried out by millions of people at every meal, by a slightly different
  route.</p>

  <p>Boiled food is more easily digested than fried or roasted (the frying
  pan should be anathema to a neuropath); lean meat than fat; fresh than
  salt; hot meat than cold; full-grown than young animals, though the
  latter are more tender; white flesh than red; while lean meat is made
  less, and fat meat more digestible, by salting or broiling. Oily dishes,
  hashes, stews, pastries and sweetmeats are hard to digest. Bread should
  be stale, and toasted crisply <i>right through</i>. The time, compared
  with the thoroughness <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> of digestion, is of little importance,
  as it varies widely within physiologic bounds.</p>

  <p>Most people fancy that the more they eat the stronger they become,
  whereas the digestion of all food beyond that actually needed to repair
  the waste due to physical and mental effort consumes priceless nerve
  energy, and weakens one. The greater part of excessive food has literally
  to be <i>burnt away</i> by the body, which causes great strain, mainly on
  the muscles. The question is not: "How much can I eat?" but: "How much do
  I need?"</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER XII</p>

<h3>INDIGESTION</h3>

  <blockquote>"We know how dismal the world looks during a fit of
  indigestion, and what a host of evils disappear as the abused stomach
  regains its tone. Indigestion has lead to the loss of battles; it has
  caused many crimes, and inspired much sulphurous theology, gloomy poetry
  and bitter satire."&mdash;Hollander.</blockquote>

  <p>The nervous dyspeptic suffers no marked pain, but often feels a
  "sinking", has no appetite, and cannot enjoy life because his stomach,
  though sound, does not get enough nerve-force to run it properly.</p>

  <p>A great deal of nerve-force is required for digestion, and if a man
  comes to the table exhausted, bolts his food, uses nerve-force scheming
  while he is bolting, and, immediately he has bolted a given amount,
  rushes off to work, digestion is imperfectly performed, nutriment is not
  assimilated, the nerve-force supply becomes deficient. He continues to
  overdraw his account in spite of the doctor's warning, and stomachic
  bankruptcy occurs, followed by a host of ills.</p>

  <p>Nervous dyspepsia is a very obstinate complaint, but if tackled
  resolutely, it can to a great extent be mitigated; but let it be
  emphasized at once, that medicines, patent or otherwise, are useless. If
  dyspepsia be aggravated by other complaints, these should receive
  appropriate treatment, but the assertions so unblushingly made in
  patent-pill advertisements are unfounded. The very variety of the
  advertised remedies is proof of the uselessness of all.</p>

<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

  <p>Set aside certain periods three times a day for meals. Fifteen minutes
  before meal times, sit in a comfortable chair, relax all your muscles,
  close the eyes, and try to make the mind a blank. <i>Rest</i>!</p>

  <p>Then eat the meal slowly and thoroughly. Conversation may lighten and
  lengthen a meal, but avoid politics, "shop" and topics of that type. What
  is wanted at table is wit, not wisdom.</p>

  <p>Water may be drunk with meals, provided it is drunk between eating,
  and not while masticating, for it has decidedly beneficial effects upon
  the digestive functions. Water is usually forbidden with meals because if
  patients drink while eating, the water usurps the functions of saliva,
  and moistens the bolus, which is then swallowed with little or no
  mastication. If you cannot drink between mouthfuls, then drink only
  between meals. <i>Never drink while food is in the mouth!</i></p>

  <p>After the meal, lie down on the right side for half an hour,
  <i>resting</i>, and so directing all available nerve-energy to getting
  digestion well under way.</p>

  <p>Indifferent appetites must be tempted by wholesome dishes made up in a
  variety of enticing ways. Fats are good, but must be taken in a tasty
  form. Eat fruit deluged with cream.</p>

  <p>The crux of digestion is to</p>

  <p>"<i>Chew</i>! CHEW!! and KEEP ON CHEWING!!!" for until food is
  thoroughly masticated there will be no relief. The only part of the whole
  digestive process placed under the control of consciousness is
  mastication, and, paradoxically, it is the only part that consciousness
  usually ignores.</p>

  <p>A healthy man never knows he has a stomach; a dyspeptic never knows he
  has anything else, because he will not <i>eat</i> his food, but throws it
  into his stomach as the average bachelor throws his belongings into a
  trunk.</p>

<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>

  <p>A varied, tasty diet, thoroughly chewed and salivated, with rest
  before and after meals, is the only means of curing dyspepsia, for no
  medicine can supply and properly distribute nerve-energy.</p>

  <p>Digestive pills are all purgatives, with a bitter to increase
  appetite, and occasionally a stomachic, bound together with syrup or
  soap. Practically all contain aloes, and very rarely a minute quantity of
  a digestive ferment like pepsin. Taken occasionally as purges, most
  digestive pills would be useful, but none are suited to continuous use,
  and the price is, as a rule, out of all proportion to the primary cost,
  while one or two are, frankly, barefaced swindles.</p>

  the probable formulæ for some well-known preparations:</p>

<h3>DIETING</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Simple diet is best; many dishes bring many diseases,"</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Pliny.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Alas! what things I dearly love&mdash;</p>

      <p>Are sure to rouse the vengeance of</p>
      <p class="i2">All pneumogastric nerves!"</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Field.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The man who pores over a book to discover the exact number of calories
  (heat units) of carbohydrates, proteins and fats his body needs, means
  well, but is wasting time.</p>

  <p>In theory it is excellent, for it should ensure maximum work-energy
  with minimum use of digestive-energy, but in practice it breaks down
  badly, a weakness to which theories are prone. One man divided four raw
  eggs, an ounce of olive oil, and a pound of rice into three meals a day.
  Theoretically, such a diet is ideal, and for a short time the
  experimenter gained weight, but malnutrition and dyspepsia set in, and he
  had to give up. The best diet-calculator is a normal appetite, and fancy
  aids digestion more than a pair of scales.</p>

  <p>In spite of rabid veget- and other "arians", most foods are good
  (making allowances for personal idiosyncrasy) if thoroughly masticated.
  The oft-quoted analogy of the cow is incorrect, for herbivora <!-- Page
  64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> are able
  to digest cellulose; but even cows masticate most laboriously.</p>

  <p>Meat juices are the most digestion-compelling substances in existence,
  and a little meat soup, "Oxo" or "Bovril" is an excellent first
  course.</p>

  <p>No one needs more than three meals per day, while millions thrive on
  one or two only, which should be ready at fixed hours; for the stomach
  when habituated becomes congested and secretes gastric juice at those
  hours without the impulse of the will, is ready to digest food, and gets
  that rest between-times which is essential to sound digestion. The man
  who has snacks between meals, and chocolates and biscuits between snacks
  can never hope to get well.</p>

  <p>To eat the largest meal at midday, as is the custom of working-men, is
  best, provided one can take half an hour's rest afterwards.</p>

  <p>Drink a pint of tepid water half an hour before every meal. If the
  stomach be very foul, add a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda to the
  water.</p>

  <p>The question of alcohol is a vexed one, but Paul's "Take a little wine
  for thy stomach's sake," is undoubtedly sound advice, though had Paul
  been trained at a London hospital, he would have added "after meals".
  Unfortunately, moderation is usually beyond the ability of the neuropath,
  and consequently he should be forbidden to take alcohol at all. Spirits
  must be avoided.</p>

  <p>Moderately strong, freshly made tea or coffee may be consumed in
  reasonable quantity.</p>

  <p>Vegetable salads are excellent if compounded with liquids other than
  vinegar or salad oil, and of ingredients other than cucumbers, radishes,
  and the like.</p>

  <p>Take little starchy food and sweetmeats. It may surprise those with "a
  sweet tooth" to learn that, to the end of the Middle Ages, sugar was used
  only as <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[pg
  65]</span> a medicine. Meat must be eaten&mdash;if at all&mdash;in the
  very strictest moderation, and never more than once a day. Eggs, fish and
  poultry&mdash;in moderation too&mdash;take its place.</p>

  <p>Healthy children need very little meat, while it is a moot point if
  children of unstable, nervous build need any at all. The diet at homes
  for epileptics is usually vegetarian, and gives excellent results.</p>

  <p>Never swallow skin, core, seeds or kernels of fruits, many of which,
  excellent otherwise, are forbidden because of the irritation caused to
  stomach and bowels by their seeds or skins.</p>

  <p>Bromides are said to give better results if salt is not taken. A
  little may be used in cooking, if, as is usually the case, the patient
  has to eat at the common table, but condiments are unnecessary and often
  irritating to delicate stomachs.</p>

  <p>The diet of nervous dyspeptics must be very simple, and though it is
  trying and monotonous to forgo harmful dainties in favour of wholesome
  dishes, it is but one of the many limitations Nature inflicts on
  neuropaths. Many an epileptic, after believing himself cured, has brought
  on a severe attack by an imprudent meal. La Rochefoucauld says:
  "Preserving the health by too strict a regimen is a wearisome malady",
  but it is open to all men to choose whether they will endure the remedy
  or the disease.</p>

  <p>Most men eat six times the minimum and twice the optimum quantity of
  food per day. For every one who starves, hundreds gorge themselves to
  death. "Food kills more than famine", and the poor, who eat sparsely from
  necessity, suffer far less from gout, cancer, rheumatism and other
  food-aggravated diseases than the rich.</p>

  <p>Most books give detailed lists of foods to be eaten and to be avoided,
  but this we believe is productive of little good.</p>

<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>

  <p>Let the patient eat a mixed diet, well and suitably cooked, taking
  what he fancies in reason, masticating everything thoroughly, and
  gradually eliminating foods which experience teaches him are difficult
  for him to digest.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER XIV</p>

<h3>CONSTIPATION</h3>

  <blockquote>"Causing a symptom to disappear is seldom the cure of
  any ill; the true course is to <i>prevent</i> the symptom."</blockquote>

  <p>Rings of muscle cause wormlike movements of the bowels, and so propel
  forward food and waste. Weakening of these muscles or their nerve
  controls from any cause, results in a "condition of the bowels in which
  motions occur only when provoked by medicines or injections". In some
  cases though motions occur freely, food ingested is retained too long in
  the digestive tract.</p>

  <p>The blood extracts what water it needs from the fluid waste in the
  large bowel, but when the weak muscles allow this to remain too long, an
  excess of moisture is removed, leaving hard, dry masses, painful to
  pass.</p>

  <p>When the fæces reach the anus, they cause an uneasy feeling, which
  directs us to seek relief, but if we neglect this impulse the bowel may
  become so insensitive that it ceases to warn its owner of the need to
  evacuate. Meantime, the muscles which expel the fæces get weak, so that
  every motion needs a strong effort of will, and much harmful
  straining.</p>

  <p>Much misery is caused by false modesty in the presence of others. It
  can never be immodest to attend to the calls of Nature, and such
  hypersensitiveness is dangerous, for rupture, piles, fissure, prolapse,
  fistula, are often due to straining.</p>

  <p>Lack of exercise weakens the intestinal and <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> abdominal muscles.
  Unsuitable or imprudent foods or drinks, indigestion, excessive worry,
  and anything that lowers the general health tend to produce
  constipation.</p>

  <p>Bacteria flourish freely in fæces, and though it is doubtful whether
  the "Auto-intoxication" so freely ascribed to them, is supported by
  facts, it cannot be doubted that, whatever the precise mechanism by which
  the effects are produced, constipation does result in a lowering of the
  resistance to disease. More frequent fits, colic, foul breath, headache
  right across the forehead, lost appetite, drowsiness, skin eruptions,
  irritability, insomnia, melancholia and anæmia (especially the "green
  sickness" of women, usually connected with menstrual irregularities) are
  but a few of many ills partly or wholly due to or consequent upon
  constipation.</p>

  <p>The symptoms of constipation of the small bowel are dry stools,
  usually light in colour.</p>

  <p>To cure this type, more water should be drunk, so that the waste may
  pass to the large bowel in a fluid state. Drink freely between meals,
  especially in summer, when profuse perspiration often causes obstinate
  constipation.</p>

  <p>The symptoms of constipation of the large bowel are furred tongue,
  f&#339;tid breath, sallow or jaundiced complexion, and mottled stools of
  round, hard balls, the first portion being very firm, and the remainder
  nearly liquid. There are occasional attacks of colic.</p>

  <p>The first step towards cure is to form regular habits. At a suitable
  time, say shortly after breakfast, or after supper if you suffer from
  hæmorrhoids, go to the lavatory, whether you feel uncomfortable or not.
  Wait patiently, do not try to hasten matters by violent straining, and if
  for some weeks there is little improvement, do not despair, for the
  habits of a lifetime are not overcome in five minutes, just because <!--
  Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> you
  have decided to amend your careless ways. A short, brisk walk beforehand
  often helps.</p>

  <p>If necessary, use a chamber and "squat" as savages do. In this
  position, the thighs support the abdomen, and force is exerted without
  straining. Massaging the abdomen by firmly rubbing it round and round,
  clockwise, with the hand, often does good, as does pressure with a finger
  on the flesh between the end of the backbone and the anus. Try every
  method before taking purgatives, for with patience and determination
  these are rarely necessary.</p>

  <p>Carefully cooked and "concentrated", easily digested and
  "pre-digested" foods contain little residue; every meal should contain
  some indigestible matter to stimulate the intestines. Brown bread,
  porridge, lettuce, cress, apples and coarse vegetables are all good for
  this purpose, but if taken too freely may cause heartburn and flatulence.
  Meat, milk, fish, eggs and most patent foods have not enough waste.
  Boiled milk is very constipating.</p>

  <p>Purgatives, injections and medicines, alone, are useless, for the
  bowel becomes still more insensitive to natural calls under the
  artificial stimulation of drugs, on which it becomes so entirely
  dependent that without their aid it will not act.</p>

  <p>It may be necessary to clean out the bowel by an enema.</p>

  <p>Make a lather with clean warm water and plain soap, and fill the enema
  syringe (a half-pint size is useful). Smear the nozzle with vaseline,
  lean forward and insert into the anus, pointing a little to the left.
  Press the bulb, withdraw the nozzle, retain the liquid a few moments and
  a desire to go to stool will be felt.</p>

  <p>A simpler plan is to buy glycerin suppositories. One is inserted into
  the anus and acts like an injection. It must be clearly understood that
  these are emergency measures.</p>

<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>

  <p>If internal piles come down at stool, do not allow them to remain and
  get engorged with blood. See that your hands are scrupulously clean, and
  your nails closely cut and free from dirt; then moisten the middle finger
  with a little vaseline taken to the lavatory for the purpose, and gently
  return the hæmorrhoids, sitting down for a few minutes to retain
  them.</p>

  <p>A mild purge may be taken once a week with advantage. Glauber's Salts
  (Sodium Sulphate), Cascara Sagrada, and liquid paraffin are all good,
  while Castor Oil Globules are suited for children.</p>

  <p>For flatulence, take a 10-minim capsule of Terebine after meals, or
  charcoal, either as French Rusks ("Biscols Fraudin") or a teaspoonful of
  powdered charcoal between meals. One drop of creosote on a lump of sugar,
  peppermint water, and sal volatile may also be used. Sufferers should
  toast bread, and use sugar sparingly.</p>

  <p>Patent medicines almost invariably contain a brisk aperient.</p>

  <p>If men but realized what complicated machines they were, they would

  The heart, no bigger than the clenched fist, beats 100,000 times a day;
  the aerating surface of the lungs is equal in area to the floors of a
  six-roomed house, and by means of its minute blood-vessels which would
  stretch across the Atlantic, 500 gallons of blood are brought into
  contact with over 3,000 gallons of air every day.</p>

  <p>Seven million sweat-glands, 30 miles long, get rid of a pint of liquid
  and an ounce of solid waste each day while it takes a tube 30 feet long,
  with millions of glands, to deal with a sip of milk.</p>

  <p>Man's finest steam engine turns one-eighth of the energy supplied into
  work; nature's engine, muscle, turns one-third into work. The body
  contains 9 gallons of water, enough carbon to make 9,000 lead pencils,
  phosphorus for 8,000 boxes of matches, iron for 5 tacks, and salt enough
  to fill half a dozen salt-cellars.</p>

  <p>Over 40 food-ferments have been found in the liver; there are
  5,000,000 red and 30,000 white blood corpuscles in a space as big as a
  pin's head, each one of which travels a mile a day and lives but a
  fortnight, <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[pg
  72]</span> millions of new ones being built up in the bone-marrow every
  second; a flash of light lasting only one eight-millionth of a second,
  will stimulate the eye, which can discriminate half a million tints. The
  ear can distinguish 11,000 tones, and is so sensitive that we hear waves
  of air less than one sixty-thousandth of an inch long; a mass of almost
  liquid jelly&mdash;for 81 per cent of the brain is water, and Aristotle
  thought it was a wet sponge to cool the hot heart&mdash;sends out
  impulses ordering our every thought and act, and stores up memory, we
  know not how or where.</p>

  <p>There are 10,000,000,000 of cells in the brain cortex alone, and
  560,000 fibres pass from the brain down the spinal cord.</p>

  <p>A clear, watery cell, no larger than the dot on an "i" encloses
  factors causing genius or stupidity, honesty or roguery, pride or
  humility, patience or impulsiveness, coldness or ardour, tallness or
  shortness, form of head or hands, colour of eyes and hair, male or female
  sex, and the thousand details that make a man.</p>

  <p>Yet man uses this marvellous mechanism but carelessly, and the
  widespread poverty, the worry and discord in the lives of the happiest,
  our ignorance, the evil habits we contract, and the vice, miseries,
  diseases and labours to which most expectant mothers are too often
  exposed, explain why one baby in every eight never walks; why but four of
  them live to manhood; why less than 40 years is now man's average span;
  and why this brief space is filled with suffering and misery, from which
  many escape by self-destruction.</p>

  <p>Sound children do not come from unclean air, surroundings, habits,
  pursuits, passions and parents. Children conceived in unsuitable
  surroundings by unsuitable parents, die; must die; <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> ought to die. They
  are not built for the stern battle of life.</p>

  <div class="noflo">

      <p>"Where the sun does not enter, the doctor does!"</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Italian proverb.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Plenty of fresh, clean air is essential to health.</p>

  <p>In all rooms a block of wood nine inches high should be inserted
  beneath the whole length of the bottom sash of the window. This leaves a
  space between the top and bottom sashes through which fresh air passes
  freely, without draught, both night and day, for it should never be
  closed. A handy man will fit a simple device to prevent the windows being
  forced at night, but better let in a burglar than keep out air.</p>

  <p>If it be cold or draughty in the bedroom, hang a sheet a foot from the
  window, put more blankets or an overcoat on the bed, or put layers of
  brown paper above the sheets, <i>but never close the window</i>.</p>

  <p>You can take too much of many good things, but never too much pure
  air.</p>

  <p><b>Cleanliness</b>. Keep the body clean by taking at least one hot
  bath per week; per day if possible. Much filth is excreted by your
  sweat-pores; why let it cake on skin and underlinen, and silently silt up
  your thirty miles of skin canals, thus overworking the other excretory
  organs, and gradually poisoning yourself?</p>

  <p>Neuropaths always suffer from sluggish circulation of the extremities,
  and to improve this, hot and cold baths, spinal douches and massage are
  excellent. A hot bath (98-110° F.) ensures a thorough cleansing, but it
  brings the blood to the surface, where its heat is quickly lost,
  enervating one, and causing a bout of shivering which increases the
  production of heat by <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> stimulating the heat-regulating centre
  in the brain. Baths above 110° F. induce faintness. To prevent shivering,
  take a cold douche after the hot bath, and have a brisk rub down with a
  coarse towel, when a delightful, warm glow will result. Do not freeze
  yourself, or the reaction will not occur; what is wanted is a short,
  sharp shock, which sends the blood racing from the skin, to which it
  returns in tingling pulsations, which brace up the whole system. The
  douche is over in a few seconds, and may be enjoyed the year round,
  commencing in late Spring.</p>

  <p>The cold bath must not be made a fetish. If the glow is not felt, give
  it up, and bathe in tepid (85-92° F.) or warm (93-98° F.) water. When
  started in the vigour of youth, the cold bath may often be continued
  through life, but it is unwise to commence in middle life. Parents should
  never force their children to take cold baths, to "harden them".</p>

  <p><b>Other Hygienic Points</b>. Tobacco is undesirable for neuropaths,
  save in moderation.</p>

  <p>Clothes should be light, loose, and warm. Epileptics should wear low,
  stiff collars, half a size too large, with clip ties. Such a combination
  does not form a tight band round the neck, and can quickly be removed if
  necessary. Wear thick, woollen socks, and square-toed, low-heeled,
  double-soled boots. Hats should be large, light, and of soft material.
  Woollen underwear is best. Change as often as possible, and aim at
  health, not appearance.</p>

  <p>Let all rooms be well lighted, well ventilated, moderately heated, and
  sparsely furnished with necessities. Shun draperies, have no window
  boxes, cut climbing plants ruthlessly away from the windows, and never
  obstruct chimneys.</p>

  <p>Buy Muller's "My System", which gives a course of physical exercises
  without apparatus, which only take fifteen minutes a day. The patient
  must conscientiously <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> perform the exercises each morning, not
  for a week, nor for a month, but for an indefinite period, or throughout
  life.</p>

  <p>Finally, remember that so few die a natural death from senile decay
  because so few live a natural life.</p>

<h3>SLEEPLESSNESS</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"O magic sleep! O comfortable bird</p>
      <p>That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind</p>
      <p>Till it is hushed and smooth."</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Keats.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some men need only a few hours' sleep, but no one ever overslept
  himself in natural slumber. There are anecdotes of great men taking
  little sleep, but their power usually consisted in going without sleep
  for some days when necessary, and making up for it in one long, deep
  sleep. Neuropaths require from 10-13 hours to prepare the brain for the
  stress of the next day, but quality is more important than quantity.</p>

  <p>Patients go to bed tired, but cannot sleep; fall asleep, and wake
  every other hour the night through; sleep till the small hours, and then
  wake, to get no more rest that night; only fall asleep when they should
  be rising; or have their slumber disturbed by nightmare, terrifying
  dreams, heart palpitation, and so on.</p>

  <p>Noise often prevents sleep. A clock that chimes the quarters, or a
  watch that in the silence ticks with sledge-hammer beats, has invoked
  many a malediction. Traffic and other intermittent noises are very
  trying, as the victim waits for them to recur. Townsmen who seek rural
  quiet have got so used to town clatter, that barking dogs, rippling
  streams, lowing cows, rustling leaves, singing birds or chirruping
  insects keep them awake. Too much light, eating a heavy supper, <!-- Page
  77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> all tend
  to banish repose, as do also violent emotions which produce toxins,
  torturing the brain and causing gruesome nightmares.</p>

  <p>Grief and worry&mdash;especially business and domestic
  cares&mdash;constipation, indigestion, bad ventilation, stimulants,
  excitement and a hearty supper are a few of the many causes of
  insomnia.</p>

  <p>In children sleeplessness is often due to the bad habit of picking a
  child up whenever it cries, usually from the pain of indigestion due to
  having been given unsuitable food. Feed children properly, and train them
  to regular retiring hours. School home-work may cause insomnia; if so,
  forbid it.</p>

  <p>Man spends a third of his life in the bedroom, which should be
  furnished and used for no other purpose. Pictures, drapery above or below
  the bed, and wallpaper with weird designs in glaring colours are
  undesirable. The wall should be distempered a quiet green or blue tint,
  and the ceiling cream. A bedroom should never be made a storeroom for
  odds and ends, nor is the space beneath the bed suitable for trunks;
  least of all for a soiled-linen basket.</p>

  <p>Some time before retiring, excitement and mental work should be
  avoided. The patient should take a quiet walk after supper, drink no
  fluid, empty bladder and bowels, and take a hot foot-bath.</p>

  <p>Retire and rise punctually, for the brain, like most other organs, may
  be trained to definite habits with patience.</p>

  <p>If sleeplessness be ascribed, rightly or wrongly, to an empty stomach,
  a glass of hot milk and two plain biscuits should be taken in bed;
  dyspeptics should take no food for three hours before retiring. If the
  patient wakes in the early morning he may find a glass of milk (warmed on
  a spirit-stove by the bedside) and a few plain biscuits of value.</p>

  <p>A victim of insomnia should lie on his side on a firm <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> bed with
  warm, light coverings, open the window, close the door, and endeavour to
  fix his attention on some monotonous idea; such as watching a flock of
  white sheep jump a hedge. Think of trifles to avoid thinking of
  troubles.</p>

  <p>How often do we hear people complain that they suffer from insomnia,
  when in fact they get a reasonable amount of sleep, and indeed often keep
  others awake by their snoring.</p>

  <p>When you wake, <i>get up</i>, for a second sleep does no good. When
  some one, on seeing the narrow camp-bed in which Wellington slept, said:
  "There is no room to turn about in it," the Iron Duke replied: "When a
  man begins to turn about in his bed it is time he turned out of it."</p>

  <p>The only safe narcotic is a day's hard work. For severe insomnia
  consult a doctor; do not take drugs&mdash;that way lies ruin. By taking
  narcotics, or patent remedies containing powerful drugs, you will easily
  get sleep&mdash;for a time only&mdash;and then fall a slave to the drug.
  Such victims may be seen in dozens in any large asylum.</p>

<h3>THE EFFECTS OF IMAGINATION</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"The surest way to health, say what they will</p>
      <p>Is never to suppose we shall be ill;</p>
      <p>Most of the ailments we poor mortals know</p>
      <p>From doctors and imagination flow."</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Churchill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="nofblk">
      <p class="i4">"Men may die of imagination,</p>
      <p class="i4">So depe may impression be take."</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Chaucer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <blockquote>"Suggestion is the introduction into the mind of a practical
  belief that works out its own fulfilment."&mdash;Guyau.</blockquote>

  <p>Man suffers from no purely imaginary ills, for mental ills are as real
  as physical ills, and though an individual be ailing simply because he
  persuades himself he is ailing, his mind so affects his body that he is
  actually unwell physically, though the cause of his trouble is purely
  mental.</p>

  <p>The suffering of this world is out of all proportion to its actual
  disease, many people being tortured by fancied ills. Some dread a certain
  complaint because a relative has died of it.</p>

  <p>Others are unwell, but while taking proper treatment they brood
  gloomily, and get worse instead of better as they should and <i>could
  do</i>.</p>

  <p>Cheap medical and pseudo-medical works are not an unmixed blessing,
  for many a person who knows, and needs to know, nothing about disease,
  gets hold <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[pg
  80]</span> of one, and soon has most of the ills known to the faculty and
  some which are not.</p>

  <p>If a patient be an optimist and persuades himself he is improving, he
  <i>does</i> improve. This is the explanation of "Faith moving mountains",
  for the curative power of prayer, Christian Science, laying-on of hands,
  suggestion treatment and patent medicine, depends on man's own faith, not
  on the supernatural.</p>

  <p>A doctor in whom a patient has perfect confidence, will do him far
  more good with the same medicines, or even with no medicines at all, than
  one of riper experience in whose skill he has no faith.</p>

  <p>Eloquent, though often inaccurate accounts of the benefits derived
  from patent medicines are persistently advertised until the mind is so
  influenced by the constant reiteration of miraculous cures, that, either
  because the healing forces of the body are thereby stimulated, or because
  the disease is curable by suggestion, the patient is benefited by such
  medicines.</p>

  <p>Thinking of pain makes it worse and vice versa.</p>

  <p>The curative effects of auto-suggestion were demonstrated at the Siege
  of Breda in 1625. The garrison was on the point of surrender when a
  learned doctor eluded the besiegers, and got in with some minute phials
  of an extraordinary Eastern Elixir, one drop of which taken after each
  meal cured all the ills flesh was heir to; two drops were fatal.</p>

  <p>The "learned doctor" was a quick-witted soldier, and the elixir was
  <i>coloured water</i> sold by order of the commander. Its potency was due
  to the faith of all, who persuaded each other they were getting better,
  and an epidemic of infectious wellness followed ills due to depressed
  spirits.</p>

  <p>One man after reading a list of symptoms said in great alarm: "Good
  Heavens. I have got that disease!" and, on turning the page, found it
  was... <i>pregnancy</i>.</p>

<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

  <p>As the great Scotch physiologist, Reid, said seventy years ago:</p>

  <blockquote>"Hope and joy promote the surface circulation of the body,
  and the elimination of waste matter and thus make the body capable of
  withstanding the causes which lead to disease, and of resisting it when
  formed. Grief, anguish and despair enfeeble the circulation, diminish or
  vitiate the secretions, favour the causes which induce disease, and
  impede the action of the mechanism by which the body may get rid of its
  maladies. An army when flushed with victory and elated with hope
  maintains a comparative immunity from disease under physical privations
  and sufferings which, under the opposite circumstances of defeat and
  despair, produce the most frightful ravages."</blockquote>

  <p>The classic description of the woeful effects of imagination is in
  Jerome's "Three Men in a Boat". Harris, having a little time on his
  hands, strolls into a public library, picks up a medical work, and
  discovers he has every affliction therein mentioned, save housemaid's
  knee. He consults a doctor friend and is given a prescription. After an
  argument with an irate chemist, he finds he has been ordered to take
  beefsteak and porter, and not meddle with matters he does not understand.
  A sounder prescription never was penned.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTION TREATMENT</h3>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"To purge the veins</p>
      <p>Of melancholy, and clear the heart</p>
      <p>Of those black fumes that make it smart;</p>
      <p>And clear the brain of misty fogs</p>
      <p>Which dull our senses, our souls clog."</p>
      <p class="i16">&mdash;Burton.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hypnosis and suggestion have suffered from those people who put back
  every reform many years&mdash;quacks and cranks&mdash;for while science,
  with open mind, was testing this new treatment, the quacks exploited it
  up hill and down dale.</p>

  <p>Yet there is nothing supernatural in suggestion, for we employ it on
  ourselves and others every hour we live. Conscience consists only of the
  countless stored-up suggestions of our education, which by opposing any
  contrary suggestions, cause uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Many of us conform through life to the suggestions of others,
  affection, awe, hero-worship and fear taking the place of reason.</p>

  <p>The most resolute of men are influenced by tactful suggestions, which
  quietly "tip-toe" on to the margin of consciousness, awaken ideas which
  link up more and more associations, until an avalanche is started which
  forces itself on to the field of consciousness, the subject thinking the
  idea is his own.</p>

  <p>Author and actor try by suggestion to make us think, laugh, or weep at
  their will, books are sold by suggestive titles, and many clothes are
  worn only to suggest wealth or respectability.</p>

<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>

  <p>The best salesman is he who by artful suggestion sells us what we do
  not want; the best buyer he who by equally astute suggestion makes the
  seller part at a price which makes him regret the bargain the moment it
  is closed.</p>

  <p>Suggestion treatment is of great use in curing nervous states and bad
  habits, and all neuropaths should practice self- or auto-suggestion. In
  severe cases a specialist must give the treatment.</p>

  <p>The patient is taken by the neurologist to a cosy,
  restfully-furnished, half-lighted room, and placed in a huge easy chair
  facing a cheery fire. He sinks into the depths of the chair, relaxes
  every muscle, allows his thoughts to wander pleasantly, and soon his
  brain is at rest, and his mind, undisturbed by the fears which usually
  harass it, is ready to receive suggestions.</p>

  <p>The doctor talks quietly, soothingly, but with the conviction born of
  knowledge to the patient about his trouble, assuring him that he
  <i>can</i> control his cravings; that he <i>can</i> put away the doubts
  or fears that have grown upon him. The true reason of his illness is
  pointed out, any little organic factors given due weight, and the idea
  that it is hereditary or due to Fate dispelled. Faults of character,
  reasoning and living are unsparingly exposed and appropriate remedies
  suggested, and he is shown how unmanly his self-torturing reproaches are,
  and how futile is remorse unless transmuted into reform.</p>

  <p>The doctor's earnestness inspires confidence, and the patient
  unburdens his secret troubles, discusses means of remedying them, and
  turns from pain to promise, from remorse to resolve, from introspection
  to action, from dreading to doing.</p>

  <p>Struck by the way the psycho-analyst reads his soul and lays bare
  petty meannesses, impressed by the patient thoroughness with which the
  doctor attends to each little symptom, confident that organic
  troubles&mdash;if <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> there be any&mdash;will receive
  appropriate treatment, ready to carry out instructions, and disposed to
  believe the new treatment is of real value: under all these
  circumstances, the physician's suggestions carry very great weight with
  the patient.</p>

  <p>The resolutions passed by the victim in this calm state sink deep into
  subconsciousness, and when next temptation, impulse or fear assails him,
  his own resolutions and the doctor's suggestions are so vividly recalled
  that he tries to control his thoughts, and, in due time he "wins
  out".</p>

  <p>Anyone may induce the calm state, and repeat suitable suggestions. The
  patient should go to a quiet room, and, reclining on a comfortable couch
  before a cheery fire, close the eyes, relax the muscles, breathe deeply,
  and avoid all sense of strain.</p>

  <p>The next step is to fix the imagination on some scene which suggests
  tranquility&mdash;smooth seas, autumnal landscapes, snow-clad heights,
  old-world gardens, deep, shady silent pools, childhood's lullabies,
  secluded backwaters, dim aisles of ancient churches.</p>

  <p>After a few evenings' practice, you will be able gradually to exclude
  all other ideas, and focus on one, inducing a state which, somewhat
  similar outwardly, is free from the excitement of religious exaltation,
  and from the delusions of a medium's trance.</p>

  <p>In this state, an appropriate suggestion must be made, sincerely, and
  with <i>absolute faith</i> in its power. Christ's miracles were the
  result of suggestive therapeutics, and He took care to inspire relatives
  with faith, to exclude scoffers, to surround himself by his believing
  Apostles, and, after treatment, said: "See thou tell no man!" well
  knowing that suggestion cannot withstand derision.</p>

  <p>In this way, a patient of limited means can do for himself exactly
  what more fortunate ones pay large fees to specialists to do for them.
  The treatment is <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> uncommon, but sound, for the medical
  profession is perhaps the most conservative on earth, and when
  specialists of repute use a method, you may be confident it is of
  value.</p>

  <p>To cure sleeplessness, see that stomach and brain are at rest, bed
  comfortable, and feet warm; calm yourself, and focus on the idea of
  sleep, saying:</p>

  <p>"I shall go to sleep in a few minutes, and wake at eight o'clock in
  the morning."</p>

  <p>Repeat this a few times, persist for a few nights and you will quickly
  get drowsy, and fall asleep.</p>

  <p>Phrases for other requirements will readily occur, as:</p>

  <p>"I shall feel confident in open spaces!"</p>

  <p>"I shall find no more pleasure in alcohol!" and so on.</p>

  <p>Suggestion will not cure epilepsy, hysteria or neurasthenia, but it
  overcomes many of the symptoms which make the patient so wretched.</p>

  <blockquote>"Crutches are hung on the walls of miraculous grottos, but
  <i>never a wooden leg</i>."</blockquote>

  <p>Suggestion may move a paralysed arm, but the muscles only become
  healthy again in many days by slow repair; suggestion releases the catch,
  but the spring must be wound up by energy suitably applied.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So distressing a malady as epilepsy early attracted attention, and
  every treatment superstition could devise, or science could suggest, has
  been tried. Culpepper in his "Herbal" (300 years old), recommends bryony;
  lunar caustic (nitrate of silver) was extensively used, because silver
  was the colour of the moon, which caused madness.</p>

  <p>The royal touch for scrofula (King's Evil) was also extended to
  epilepsy, the king blessing a ring, which was worn by the sufferer.</p>

  <p>Another old remedy was to cut off a lock of the victim's hair while in
  a seizure and put it in his hand, which stopped (?) the attack. In
  Berkshire a piece of silver collected at the communion service and made
  into a ring was specific, but in Devon a ring made of three nails from an
  old coffin was preferred. Lupton says: "A piece of child's navel-string
  borne in a ring is good against falling sickness."</p>

  <p>Nearly every drug in the Pharmacop&#339;ia has been tried, the drugs
  now generally used being sodium, potassium and ammonium bromide.</p>

  <p>Before bromides were introduced by Locock in <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> 1857, very strict
  hygienic, dietic and personal disciplinary treatment combined with the
  use of drugs often effected improvement. Since the use of bromides, these
  personal habits have, unfortunately, been neglected, far too much
  reliance being placed on the "three times a day after meals" formula.</p>

  <p>All bromides are quickly absorbed from the stomach and bowels, and
  enter the blood as sodium bromide, which lowers the activity of both
  motor and sensory centres, and renders the brain less sensitive to
  disturbing influences.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the influence of bromides is variable, uncertain, and
  markedly good in only a small proportion of cases.</p>

  <p>In about 25 per cent of cases, in which mild seizures occur at long
  periods, without mental impairment, the bromides arrest the seizures,
  either temporarily or permanently, after a short course. In another 25
  per cent the bromides lessen the frequency and severity of the fits, this
  being the common <i>temporary</i> result of their use in <i>all cases</i>
  in the first stages.</p>

  <p>In quite 50 per cent of cases, the effect of bromides diminishes as
  they are continued, and they finally exert no influence at all. Many
  cases are temporarily "cured", the drug is stopped, and the seizures
  recur. Bromides are valuable in recent and mild cases, but no medicine
  exerts much effect on severe cases of long standing, which usually end in
  an institution.</p>

  <p>When these drugs are taken continuously, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness,
  confusion of thought and speech, lapses of memory, palpitation, furred
  tongue, unsteady walk, acne and other symptoms of "bromism" may arise,
  whereupon the patient must stop taking bromides and see a doctor, who
  will substitute other drugs for a time.</p>

  <p>If heart palpitation be troublesome while using <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> bromides, take a
  teaspoonful of sal volatile in water.</p>

  <p>See a doctor if you can; <i>until</i> you see him, get from a
  chemist:</p>

  <table cellpadding="5" summary="bromide">
      <tr><td>Potassii bromidi</td><td class="r">10 grains.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Sodii bromidi</td><td class="r">10 grains.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Boracis purificati</td><td class="r">5 grains.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Aquæ</td><td class="r">1 fluid ounce.</td></tr>
      <tr><td colspan="2">Two tablespoonfuls in water three times a<br />
      day after meals.</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>This prescription is for an adult. If the patient be under twenty-one,
  tell the chemist his age, and he will make it up proportionately.</p>

  <p>Victims who have seizures with some regularity at a certain time,
  should take the three doses in one, two hours before the attack is
  expected. If there are long intervals between attacks, cease taking
  bromides after one fit and recommence three weeks before the next seizure
  is apprehended. When there is an interval of six months or more between
  attacks, take no drugs.</p>

  <p>Bromides in solution are unpalatable, patients grow careless of
  regularity and dosage.</p>

  <p>You must learn from your doctor and your own experience the
  prescription, time and dose best suited to your case, and then <i>never
  miss a dose until you have been free from fits for two years</i>, for the
  beneficial action of bromide depends on the tissues becoming and
  remaining "saturated" with the drug. Never give up bromides suddenly
  after long use, but gradually reduce the dose.</p>

  <p>It is just when the disease has been brought under control, that
  patients consider further doctor's bills an unnecessary expense, with the
  result that a little later the fits recur, and a tedious treatment has to
  be commenced over again.</p>

  <p>No value can be placed on any specific for epilepsy until it has been
  thoroughly tested for some years, and so proved that its effects are
  permanent, for almost any treatment is of value for a time, possibly
  through the agency of suggestion.</p>

<h3>PATENT MEDICINES</h3>

  <blockquote>"Men who prescribe purifications and spells and other
  illiberal practices of like kind."&mdash;Hippocrates.</blockquote>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"...Corrupted</p>
      <p>By spell and medicines bought of mountebanks."</p>
      <p class="i16">"Othello." Act I.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Carlyle said the world consisted of "so many million people, <i>mostly
  fools</i>"; and he was right, for to public credulity alone is due the
  immense growth of the patent-medicine trade.</p>

  <p>It was formerly thought that for each disease, a specific drug could
  be found, but this idea is exploded. The doctor determines the exact
  condition of his patient, considers how he best may assist nature or
  prevent death, and selects suitable drugs. He carefully notes their
  action and modifies his treatment as required. The use of set
  prescriptions for set diseases is obsolete; the doctor of to-day treats
  the patient, not the disease.</p>

  <p>A few patent medicines are of limited value; many are made up from
  prescriptions culled from medical works, and the rest are frauds, like
  potato starch. The evil lies in charging from three to four hundred times
  a just price, in ascribing to a medicine which may be good for a certain
  disorder, a "cure-all" virtue it does not possess, and in inducing <!--
  Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>
  ignorant people to take powerful drugs, reckless of results.</p>

  <p>Ephemeral patent-medicine businesses, run by charlatans, whose aim is
  frankly to make money before they are exposed, spring up like mushrooms;
  and their cunningly worded advertisements meet the eye in the columns of
  every paper one opens for a few months; then they drop out, to reappear
  under another name, at another address. These rogues buy a few gross
  pills from a wholesale druggist, insert a small advertisement, and so lay
  the foundations of a profitable business.</p>

  <p>The lure of the unknown is turned to account. "The discoverer went
  back to the Heart of Nature&mdash;and found many rare herbs used by
  Native Tribes." "The "Heart of Nature" was probably a single-room office
  tucked away down a Fleet Street alley, and analysis proves these
  medicines contain only common drugs, one "<i>Herbal Remedy</i>" being
  <i>metallic</i> phosphates.</p>

  <p>A common procedure is to send a question form, and, after answering
  the query, "What are you suffering from?" with "Neurasthenia", the
  company "carefully study" this, and then inform you with a gravity that
  would grace the pages of "Punch", "You are the victim of a very
  intractable type of Neurasthenia", so intractable in fact that it will
  need "additional treatment"&mdash;at an "additional" fee.</p>

  <p>The quack's advertisements are models of the skilful use of
  suggestion, and turn to rare account the half-knowledge of physiology
  most men pick up from periodicals. He frightens you with alarming and
  untrue statements, gains your confidence by a display of semi-true facts
  reinforced where weak by false assertions, and, having benefited himself
  far more than you, leaves you to do what you should have done at first,
  go to a doctor or a hospital.</p>

<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>

  <p>Were it made compulsory for the recipe to be printed on all patent
  medicines, people would lose their childlike faith in coloured water and
  purges, and cease the foolish and dangerous practice of treating diseases
  of which they know little with drugs of which they know less.</p>

  <p>The British Medical Association of 429, Strand, London, W.C., issue
  two 1<i>s</i>. books&mdash;"Secret Remedies: What they cost and what they
  contain", "More Secret Remedies"&mdash;giving the ingredients and cost
  price of most patent medicines. You are strongly urged to send for these
  books, which should be in every home.</p>

  <p><i>The basis of every cure for epilepsy</i> (not obviously fraudulent)
  <i>is bromides</i>. The usual method is to condemn vigorously the use of
  potassium bromide, and substitute ammonium or sodium bromide for it. Some
  advertisers condemn all the bromides, and prescribe a mixture of them;
  others condemn potassium bromide, and shamelessly forward a pure solution
  of this same salt in water as a "positive cure!"</p>

  <p>In all cases the sale price is out of reasonable proportion to the
  cost, victims paying outrageous sums for very cheap drugs.</p>

  <p>Most epileptics are poor, because their infirmity debars them from
  continuous or well-paid work, leaving them dependent on relatives, often
  in poor circumstances also. The picture of patients, already lacking many
  real necessities, still further denying themselves for weeks or months to
  purchase a worthless powder, is truly a pitiful one.</p>

  <p>Bromides are unsatisfactory drugs in the treatment of epilepsy, but
  they are the best we have at present. Get them made up to the
  prescription of a doctor, and see him every month to report progress and
  be examined. In the end, this plan will be very much <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> cheaper, and
  incomparably better, than buying crude bromides from quacks.</p>

<hr />

  <p>There is no drug treatment for either hysteria or neurasthenia, and
  when the doctor gives medicines for these complaints, it is to remedy
  organic troubles, or, more often because necessity forces him to pander
  to the irrational and pernicious habit into which the public have fallen
  of expecting a bottle of medicine whenever they visit a doctor. Osier,
  the famous Professor of Medicine at Oxford, truly observed that he was
  the best doctor who knew the uselessness of medicines. But when public
  opinion demands a bottle, and is unwilling either to accept or pay for
  advice alone, the doctor may be forced to give medicines which he feels
  are of little value, hoping that their suggestive power will be greater
  than is their therapeutic value.</p>

  <p>Neuropaths invariably contract the habit of physicking themselves, and
  taking patent foods and drugs which are valueless.</p>

  <p>So universal is this pernicious habit that we deem it desirable to
  criticize it here at some length.</p>

  <p>One highly popular type consists of port wine, reinforced (?) by malt
  and meat extracts, and sold under a fanciful name. It has about the same
  value as a bottle of port, which costs considerably less. It is well to
  remember that many a confirmed drunkard has commenced with these
  "restoratives".</p>

  <p>Malt extracts are also popular. They contain diastase, and therefore
  aid the digestion of starch, but the diastatic power of most commercial
  extracts is negligible.</p>

  <p>Meat extracts of various makes contain no nourishment, but are
  valuable appetisers. Meat gravy is as effective and far cheaper.</p>

<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>

  <p>Foods containing digestive ferments, which are widely advertised under
  various proprietary names are practically valueless, as are the ferments
  themselves sold commercially. Digestive disorders are very rarely due to
  deficiency of ferments, while pepsin is the only one among all the
  ferments that could act (and that only for a little while) in the
  digestive system.</p>

  <p>Some of the disadvantages of predigested foods have been noted, and
  their prices are usually so exorbitant that eggs at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
  each would be cheaper. The remarks of Sollmann the great pharmacologist
  are pertinent:</p>

  <blockquote><i>Limitations</i>. The administration of food in the guise
  of medicine is sometimes advantageous; but medicinal foods are subject to
  the ordinary law of dietetics, and therefore cannot accomplish the
  wonders which are often claimed for them. The proprietary foods have been
  enormously overestimated, and have probably done more harm than good. The
  ultimate value of any food depends mainly on the amount of calories which
  it can yield, and on its supplying at least a minimum of proteins. In
  these respects, the medical foods are all inferior, for they cannot be
  administered practically in sufficient quantity to supply the needs of
  the body. They have a place as adjuvants to other foods, permitting the
  introduction of more food than the patient could otherwise be induced to
  take. Aside from the special diabetes foods and cod-liver oil, their
  value is largely psychic.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><i>Predigested Foods</i>. The value of these is doubtful, for
  digestive disturbances involve the motor functions and absorption more
  commonly than the chemical functions. Their continued use often produces
  irritation.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><i>Liquid Predigested Foods</i>. As sold, these are <!-- Page
  95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> flavoured
  solutions containing small amounts (½-6 per cent) of predigested
  proteins, ½-15 per cent of sugars and other carbohydrates, with 12-19 per
  cent of alcohol, and often with large quantities (up to 30 per cent) of
  glycerin. Their protein content averages less than that of milk, and in
  energy value they are vastly inferior. Their daily dose yields but 55-300
  calories including their alcohol; this is only one-thirtieth to one-fifth
  the minimum requirements of resting patients. To increase their dose to
  that required to maintain nutrition would mean the ingestion of an amount
  of alcohol equivalent to a pint of whisky per day.</blockquote>

  <p>Of recent years very expensive preparations of real or alleged organic
  iron compounds have had a large sale. Iron is a component of hæmoglobin,
  a solid constituent (13 per cent by weight) of the blood, which combines
  with the oxygen in the lungs, and is carried (as oxyhæmoglobin) all over
  the body, giving the oxygen up to the tissues. Hæmoglobin is an
  exceedingly complex substance, but it contains only one-third per cent by
  weight of iron in organic form.</p>

  <p>The liver is the storehouse of iron, its reserve being depleted when
  there is an extraordinary demand for iron. The minute amounts of iron in
  ordinary food are amply sufficient for all our needs; any excess is
  simply stored, and, later excreted, and has no effect whatever on the
  circulating hæmoglobin.</p>

  <p>Iron is only of value in certain forms of anæmia, and the many patent
  medicines purporting to contain hæmoglobin or organic iron are therefore
  useless to neuropaths. The Roman plan of drinking water in which swords
  had been rusted, is quite as valuable as drinking expensive proprietary
  compounds. When iron is indicated Blaud's Pills are perhaps the best
  preparation.</p>

<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>

  <p>Huge quantities of patent medicines containing phosphates in the form
  of hypo-or glycerophosphates, and (or) lecithin are sold annually.</p>

  <p>All phosphorus compounds are reduced to inorganic phosphates in the
  digestive tract, absorbed and eliminated, so that, as with iron, if
  phosphates are needed, the form in which they are taken is of no moment.
  Why, then, pay huge sums for organic-phosphorus compounds (synthesized
  from inorganic phosphates) when they are immediately reduced to the same
  constituents from which they were constructed, the only value in the
  reduction process being seen in the immense fortunes which
  patent-medicine proprietors accumulate?</p>

  <p>Lecithin is isolated from animal brain, or egg-yolk, and commercial
  lecithin is impure. Not only does the ordinary daily diet contain ample
  lecithin (5 grammes), but two eggs will double this, while liver or
  sweetbread, both rich in phosphorous, may be eaten.</p>

  <p>The much-vaunted glycerophosphates are decomposed to and excreted as
  phosphates. Sollmann's remarks apply to all similar proprietary
  articles:</p>

  <blockquote>"A proprietary compound of glycerophosphates and casein has
  been widely and extravagantly advertised as 'Sanatogen'. It is a very
  costly food, and in no sense superior to ordinary casein, such as cottage
  cheese."</blockquote>

  <p>Hypophosphites have been boomed by various people, chiefly for
  financial reasons. Five or six of them are usually prescribed, with the
  addition of cod liver oil, and perhaps quinine, and (or) iron and
  strychnine, the complexity of the prescription being expected,
  apparently, to compensate for the uselessness of its various
  ingredients.</p>

  <p>To deduce rational remedies, it is first necessary to <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> elucidate
  the causes of inefficiency; and to expect a brain which is out of order
  to function in an orderly manner simply because it is supplied with one
  of the substances necessary to its normal functioning (regardless of
  whether a deficiency of that substance is the cause of the disorder), is
  as rational as it would be to expect to restart an automobile engine, the
  magneto of which was broken, by filling up the half-empty petrol
  tank.</p>

<h3>TRAINING THE NERVOUS CHILD</h3>

  <blockquote>"When shall I begin to train my child?" said a young mother
  to an old doctor.<br />
  "How old is the child, madam?"<br />
  "Two years, sir!"<br />
  "Then, madam, you have lost just two years," answered the old
  physician, gravely.</blockquote>

  <p>Neuropathic children are super-emotional, and from them come
  prodigies, geniuses, perverts and madmen. They are usually spare of
  build, with pale, sallow complexions, and dark rings under the eyes.</p>

  <p>They can never sit still, but wriggle restlessly about on their seats,
  pick their nostrils, and bite their nails. They are always wanting to be
  doing something, but soon tire of it, and start something else, which is
  as quickly cast aside; their energy is feverish but fitful. They jump to
  conclusions, quickly grasp ideas; as quickly forget them. Having no
  capacity for calm, reasoned judgment, they are creatures of impulse,
  imperative but timid, suffer from strange ideas, and worry over
  trifles.</p>

  <p>The affections are strong and vehement, likes and dislikes are taken
  without reason, while intense personal attachments&mdash;often
  unrequited&mdash;occur, but not seldom swing round to indifference, or
  even bitter enmity. The passions and emotions are all abnormal, for owing
  to deficiency in the higher inhibitory centres, the victim is blown about
  by every idle emotional wind that blows. The slightest irritation may
  provoke <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[pg
  99]</span> an outburst of maniacal rage, or a fit. Consequently, they
  require the most careful, but firm training, right from birth, to bring
  them up with a minimum of nerve-strain. Twitchings, night or day terrors,
  sleep walking, and incontinence of urine often trouble them. They should
  be examined by a doctor once a year.</p>

  <p>These children have no <i>balance</i>, and are usually selfish, always
  garrulous, with a love of romancing, while a ready wit combined with
  fertile imagination often gains them a bubble reputation for learning
  they do not possess. Invention, poetry, music, artistic taste and
  originality are occasionally of a high order, and the memory is sometimes
  phenomenal; but desultory, half-finished work, and shiftlessness are the
  rule.</p>

  <p>Their appetite is fitful and fanciful, they like unsuitable foods, and
  their digestive system is easily upset. At puberty, sexual perversity is
  common, and the animal appetite, is as a rule, very strong, though
  rarely, it may be absent. During adolescence, there is excessive shyness
  or bravado, always introspection, and exaggerated self-consciousness.</p>

  <p>As they grow older, they readily contract hypochondria, neurasthenia,
  hysteria, alcoholism, insomnia and drug habits, and react unduly to the
  most trifling external causes, even to the weather, by which they are
  exhilarated or depressed.</p>

  <p><b>Education</b>. Send them to school only when the law compels you,
  and observe them closely while there, for health is far more important to
  them than education. "Infant prodigies" lack the mental staying power and
  physical robustness which real success demands, though they may do well
  for a time. Go to your old school: the successes of to-day were dunces
  twenty years ago; about those whose names are proudly emblazoned in
  fading gold on Rolls of Honour, a discreet silence is maintained.</p>

  <p>Keep a keen lookout for symptoms of over-effort. <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
  Sleepiness, languor, a vacant expression, forehead wrinkled, eyebrows
  knit, eyes dull, sunken and surrounded by dark rings, twitchings,
  restlessness, or loss of appetite are all warnings that the pace is too
  strong for the child.</p>

  <blockquote>"These are the cases in which the School Board&mdash;who
  ordain that if children are well enough to play or run errands, they are
  well enough to attend school&mdash;should be defied."</blockquote>

  <p>This defiance must of course be reinforced by a doctor's
  certificate.</p>

  <p>To the healthy, the strain of preparing for and enduring an
  examination is tremendous; to highly strung children it is dangerous.
  Home-work should be forbidden in spite of the authorities. Let the child
  join in the sports of the school as much as possible.</p>

  <p>School misdemeanours form a thorny problem, for discipline must be
  maintained, and a stern but just discipline is very wholesome for this
  type, who are too apt to assume that because they are abnormal, they can
  be idle and refractory. On the other hand, parents should promptly and
  vigorously object to their children being punished for errors in lessons,
  or struck on the head.</p>

  <p><b>Diet</b>. Food, while being nourishing, and easily digested, must
  not be stimulating or "pappy". Meat, condiments, tea, coffee and alcohol
  are highly undesirable, a child's beverage being milk and water.</p>

  <p>Meals should be ready at regular hours, and capricious appetites
  should freely be humoured among suitable foods, served in appetizing form
  to tempt the palate. Let them chatter, but see they do not get the time
  to talk by bolting their food.</p>

  <p>Most children can chew properly soon after they are two, but they are
  never taught. Their food is <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> "mushy", or is carefully cut, and
  gives them no incentive to masticate. So long as food is digestible, the
  harder it is the better, and plain biscuits, raw fruits, and foods like
  "Grape Nuts", are splendid. Mastication helps digestion; it also prevents
  nasal troubles.</p>

  <p>The desire for food at odd moments causes trouble, which is aggravated
  if the meals are not ready at stated hours. Gently but firmly refuse the
  piece of bread-and-butter they crave, explain why you do so, and though
  they weep, or fly into a passion, do not lose your own temper, or beat,
  or give way to them. When accustomed to regular hours and firm refusals
  they will not crave for titbits between meals.</p>

  <p>It is very hard for them to see other members of the family freely
  partaking of condiments, drinks and unsuitable foods, and be told they
  are the only ones who must refrain. A little personal self-sacrifice
  helps immensely, and if your child <i>must</i> refrain so <i>might</i>
  you.</p>

  <p>All foods must be pure. Avoid tinned goods, and cheap jams, which
  contain mangels and glucose. Judged by the nutriment they
  contain&mdash;most cheap foods are very expensive.</p>

  <p>Lightly boil, poach, or scramble eggs; steam fish and vegetables; cook
  rice and sago in the oven for three hours. See that milk puddings are
  chewed, for usually they are bolted more quickly than anything else. The
  stomach is expected to deal with unchewed rice pudding, because it is
  "nourishing". So are walnuts, but you do not swallow them whole.</p>

  <p>Fruit must be fresh, ripe and raw, with skin and core removed. Brown
  bread, crisply toasted and buttered when cold, is best. Porridge is
  admirable, but many children dislike it. Try to induce a taste by giving
  plenty of milk, and sugar or syrup with it.</p>

  <p>The starch-digesting ferments in the saliva and pancreas are not
  active until the age of 18 months, before <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> which infants must
  not be given starchy foods like potatoes, cereals, puddings and
  bread.</p>

  <p>All greenstuffs must be thoroughly washed, or worms may pass into the
  system. Foul breath, picking the nose, restlessness, fever and startings
  are often attributed to worms, when the real "worms" are mince pies,
  raisins, sour apples, and even beer.</p>

  <p>Never force fat on children in a form they do not like, for there are
  plenty of palatable fats, as butter, dripping, lard and milk. Cream is as
  cheap, as good, and far nicer than cod-liver oil.</p>

  <p>Decide on your children's diet, but do not discuss it with or before
  them. If a child <i>does</i> dislike a dish, never force it on him, but
  try to induce a liking by serving it in a more appetizing way. Never mix
  medicines with food.</p>

  <p><b>Worms</b>. Various symptoms are due to intestinal worms, and a
  sharp lookout should be kept for the appearance of any in the stools, and
  suitable treatment given when necessary.</p>

  <p>Treatment for thread and round worms:</p>

  </table>

  <p><b>Tapeworms</b>. These are rarer, being much more frequently talked
  or read about than seen. A doctor should be consulted.</p>

  <p><b>Moral Training</b>. The road to hell is broad and easy; so is that
  to heaven, for if bad habits are easily acquired, so are good ones.</p>

  <p>Example is the best moral precept, and if the conduct <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span> of parents
  is good, little moral exhortation is needed. "What is the moral ideal set
  before children in most families? Not to be noisy, not to put the fingers
  in the nose or mouth, not to help themselves with their hands at table,
  not to walk in puddles when it rains, etc. To be 'good'!" To hedge in the
  child's little world, the most wonderful it will ever know, by hidebound
  rules enforced by severe punishments, is to repress a child, not to train
  it. While the commonest error is to spoil a child, it is just as harmful
  to crush it. Be firm, be kindly, and, above all, <i>be fair</i>.</p>

  <p>Issue no command hastily, but only if necessary, and shun prohibitions
  based on petulance or pique. Give the child what it wants if easily
  obtainable and not harmful.</p>

  <p>If the desire is harmful, explain why, but if a child asks for a toy,
  do not pettishly reply: "It's nearly bedtime!" when it is not, or even if
  it is.</p>

  <p>Discipline is essential, but discipline does not consist in
  inconsistent nagging; harshly insisting on unquestioning obedience to
  some unreasonable command one moment, and weakly giving way&mdash;to
  avoid a scene&mdash;on some matter vitally affecting the child's welfare
  the next.</p>

  <p>There must be no coddling, and no inducement to self-pity. Such
  children must be taught that they are capable of real success and real
  failure, and that upon personal obedience to the laws of health of body
  and of mind, this success or failure largely depends.</p>

  <p>A child should be early accustomed to have confidence in himself. For
  this purpose all about him must encourage him and receive with kindliness
  whatever he does or says out of goodwill, only giving him gently to
  understand, if necessary, that he might have done better and been more
  successful if he had followed this or that other course. Nothing is more
  apt to deprive a child of confidence in himself than to tell him brutally
  <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>[pg
  104]</span> that he does not understand, does not know how, cannot do
  this or that, or to laugh at his attempts. His educators must persuade
  him that he <i>can</i> understand, and that he <i>can</i> do this thing
  or that, and must be pleased with his slightest effort.</p>

  <p>It seems a trifle to let a child have the run of cake plate or
  sweet-tray, or to stay up "just another five minutes, Mummy!" to avoid a
  howl, but these are the trifles that sow acts to reap habits, habits to
  reap character, and character to fulfil destiny. It is selfish of parents
  to avoid trouble by not teaching their children habits of obedience,
  self-restraint, order and unselfishness. Between five and ten is the age
  of greatest imitation, when habits are most readily contracted.</p>

  <p>Come to no decision until hearing the child's wishes or statements,
  and thinking the matter out; having come to it, <i>be inexorable</i>
  despite the wiles, whines and wails of a subtle child. Reduce both
  promises and threats to a minimum, but <i>rigidly</i> fulfil them, for a
  threat which can be ignored, and a promise unfulfilled, are awful errors
  in training a child.</p>

  <p>Persuade, rather than prohibit or prevent, a child from doing harmful
  actions. If it wants to touch a hot iron, say clearly it is hot, and will
  burn, but <i>do not move it</i>. Then, if the child persists, it will
  touch the iron tentatively, and the small discomfort will teach it that
  obedience would have been better. Let it learn as far as possible by the
  hard, but wholesome, road of experience.</p>

  <p>Makeshift answers must never be given to a child. Awkward questions
  require truthful answers, even though these only suggest more "Whys?"</p>

  <p>Sentimentality must be nipped promptly in the bud, and an imaginative
  and humorous view of things encouraged. The child must be taught to keep
  the passions under control, and to face pain (that great <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> educator
  which neurotic natures feel with exaggerated keenness) with
  fortitude.</p>

  <p>Fear must be excluded from a child's experience. "Bogies!" "Ghosts!"
  "Robbers!" and "Black-men!" if unintroduced, will not naturally be
  feared. The mental harm a highly strung child does by rearing most
  fearsome imaginings on small foundations is incalculable, and has led
  more than one to an asylum.</p>

  <p>Try to train the child to go to sleep in the dark, but if it is
  frightened give it a nightlight. As Guthrie says, the comfort derived
  from the assurance that Unseen Powers are watching over it, is small
  compared to that given by a nightlight. He mentions a child who, when
  told she need not fear the dark because God would be with her, said: "I
  wish you'd take God away and leave the candle."</p>

  <p>If the child wakes terrified, it is stupid and wicked to call
  upstairs: "Go to sleep!" A child cannot go to sleep in that state, and a
  wise mother will go up and softly soothe the frightened eyes to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>Neuropathic children often have night terrors within an hour or two of
  going to bed. Piercing screams cause a hasty rush upstairs, where the
  child is found sitting up in bed, crouching in a corner, or trying to get
  out of door or window. His face is distorted with fear and he stares
  wildly at the part of the room in which he sees the terrifying
  apparition. He clings to his mother but does not know her. After some
  time he recovers, but is in a pitiful state and has to have his hand held
  while he dozes fitfully off. He often wets the bed or passes a large
  amount of colourless urine. Medical treatment is imperative.</p>

  <p>Corporal punishment is unsuitable for neuropathic children, for the
  mere suggestion of its application usually causes such excessive dread,
  mental upset and terror as make it really dangerous. Such children are
  often said to be "naughty" when in reality they are <!-- Page 106
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> unable to
  exercise self-control, owing to defective inhibitory power. Try patiently
  to inculcate obedience from the desire to do right, and make chastisement
  efficacious from its very exceptional character.</p>

  <p>"The young child is too unconscious to have a deliberately perverse
  intention; to ascribe to him the fixed determination to do evil, is to
  judge him unjustly and often to develop in him an evil instinct. It is
  better in such a case to tell him he has made a mistake, that he did not
  foresee the consequences to which his action might lead, etc." Many
  parents fall into a habit of shaking, ear-boxing, and such-like harmful
  minor punishments for equally minor offences, which should be
  overlooked.</p>

  <p>In all little troubles, keep <i>quite calm</i>. The child's nerve and
  association centres have not yet got "hooked up", and you cannot expect
  it to act reasonably instead of impulsively. This excuse does not apply
  to you. One excitable person is more than enough, for if both get angry,
  sensible measures will certainly not result.</p>

  <p>The necessity for calmness cannot too strongly be urged. The treatment
  for a fit of temper, is to give the unfortunate child a warm bath, and
  put it to bed, with a few toys, when it will soon fall asleep, and awake
  refreshed and calm.</p>

  <p>Proceed gently but with absolute firmness, <i>start early</i>, and
  remember that example is better than precept.</p>

  <p><b>Religion</b>. Offering advice on this subject is skating on very
  thin ice, and we do so but to give grave warning against neuropathic
  youth being allowed to contract religious "mania", "ecstasy", or
  "exaltation".</p>

  <p>Neuropaths are given naturally to "see visions and dream dreams", and
  if this tendency be exaggerated an unbalanced moral type results. Jones
  says:</p>

  <blockquote>"The epileptic is apt to be greatly influenced by the
  mystical or awe-inspiring, and is disposed <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> to morbid piety. He
  has an outer religiousness without corresponding strictness of morals;
  indeed the sentiment of religious exaltation may be in great contrast to
  his habitual conduct, which is a mixture of irritability, vice and
  perverted instincts."</blockquote>

  <p>Lay stress on the simple moral teaching of the New Testament, and
  avoid cranky creeds, cross references, or Higher Criticism. Teach them to
  practise the moral precepts, not to quote them by the page.</p>

  <p>Without this practical bent, a "Revival" meeting is apt to result in a
  transient but harmful "conversion"; a form of religious sentiment which
  finds outlet, not so much in works as in morbid excitement. In these
  people, as in the insane, there is often a weird mixing-up of religious
  and sexual emotion.</p>

  <p>Teach these children that the greatest good is not to sob over their
  fancied sins at "salvation" meetings, but to love the just and good, to
  hate the unjust and evil, and to do unto others as they would others
  should do unto them.</p>

  <p>It is better for them to join one of the great churches, than become
  members of those small sects which maintain peculiar tenets.</p>

  <p>A word of special warning must be given against Spiritualism. There
  may or may not be a foundation for this belief, but it is highly
  abnormal, and has led thousands into asylums.</p>

  <p>The medium and the majority of her audience are highly neurotic, and a
  more unwholesome environment for an actual or potential neuropath could
  not be imagined.</p>

  <p>The educated neuropath often peruses certain agnostic works, the
  result usually being deplorable, for this class are dependent on some
  stable base outside themselves, such as is found in a calm religion
  manifested <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> in a steadfast attempt to overcome the
  weakness of the flesh, by ordering life in accordance with the teachings
  of the New Testament.</p>

  <p>So long as abnormalities of character do not become too pronounced,
  friends must be content.</p>

  <p>Such children must be trained to express themselves in a practical
  manner, not in weaving gorgeous phantasies in which they march to
  imaginary victory. Day dreams form one of those unlatched doors of the
  madhouse that swing open at a touch, the phantasy of to-day being written
  "emotional dementia" on a lunacy certificate to-morrow.</p>

  <p>Finally, remember that above them hangs the curse:</p>

  <p>"Unstable as water, <i>thou shall not excel</i>."</p>

  <p>"Go thou softly with them, all their days!" and whether your tears
  fall on the ashes of a loved and loving, but weak and wilful one, or
  whether their tears bedew the grave of the only friend they ever knew,
  you will not have lacked a rich reward.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At puberty (from the age of 11-15) a boy becomes capable of paternity,
  a girl of maternity; during adolescence (from puberty to 25) the body in
  general, and the reproductive organs in particular, grow and mature.</p>

  <p>In the boy, semen is secreted, the voice breaks, the genitals enlarge,
  hair grows on the pubes, face and armpits, and there is a rapid increase
  in height owing to growth of bone. In the girl menstruation commences,
  the pelvis is enlarged, bust and breasts develop, the complexion
  brightens, the hair becomes glossy, and the eyes bright and
  attractive.</p>

  <p>In both, the sexual instinct awakens, and the mental, like the
  physical, changes are profound. There is great general instability, the
  child, at one time shy <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> and reticent, is at another,
  boisterous and self-assertive.</p>

  <p>Parents rarely realize the importance and trying nature of this period
  when "there awakes an appetite which in all ages has debased the weak,
  wrestled fiercely with the strong and overwhelmed too often even the
  noble". Adolescents suffer more from the lack of understanding,
  sympathy, appreciation and wise guidance shown by their blind parents,
  than they do from their own ignorance and perfervid imagination.</p>

  <p>The transitions from radiant joy and confident expectation, reared on
  a flimsy basis of supposition, to dire despair consequent on a wrong
  reading of physical and mental changes, are rapid. Friends, lovers and
  heroes quickly succeed one another, play their parts, and give place to
  others.</p>

  <p>The awakening of the sexual appetite is usually ignored, and children
  are left to gain knowledge of man's noblest power from companions, casual
  references in the Bible and other books, and unguarded references in
  conversation. Under such conditions not one in a thousand&mdash;and
  <i>your</i> child is <i>not</i> that one&mdash;escapes impurity and
  degraded sex ideas.</p>

  <p>Wherever youth congregate, this subject crops up, and those who talk
  most freely to the others are just those with the most distorted and
  vicious ideas, whose discourse abounds in obscene detail and ribald jest.
  Your child must learn either from ignorant, unclean minds, or be taught
  in a clean, sacred way, which will rob sex of secrecy and obscenity;
  <i>learn he will</i>; if you will not teach your child, his pet rabbit
  will.</p>

  <p>When children ask awkward questions, say quietly that such matters are
  not discussed with children, but promise to tell them all about it when
  they are ten years old; delay no longer, for most children learn
  self-abuse between ten and twelve.</p>

  <p>Self-abuse is a bad habit, and no more a "sin" than <!-- Page 111
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> is biting
  the nails. Unfortunately, people with no other qualification than a
  desire to do good, wrongly harp on the "sin" of it and draw lurid
  pictures of physical and mental wreck as the end of such "sinners",
  ignorant that if all masturbators went mad the world would be one huge
  asylum.</p>

  <p>Exaggeration never pays in teaching youth. Tell the truth, which is
  bad enough without adding "white lies" with an eye to effect.</p>

  <p>Coitus causes slight prostration, Nature's device to remind man to
  keep sexual intercourse within bounds, for while in moderation it is
  harmless, in excess it causes great prostration. <i>Exactly the same
  applies to self-abuse</i>, for, paradoxical as it seems, the real harm is
  done by the <i>fear</i> of the supposed harm.</p>

  <p>The masturbator first suffers from the knowledge he is indulging in a
  pleasure he knows would be forbidden, and from fear of being found out;
  later he learns from friends, quack advertisements, or well-meaning books
  that self-abuse is a most deadly practice, and thereupon a tremendous
  struggle occurs between desire and fear, each act ending in an agony of
  remorse and dread of future consequences, which struggle does a
  thousand-fold more harm than the loss of a little semen.</p>

  <p>The ill-effects of these mental struggles disappear after marriage,
  which means greater indulgence, but indulgence free from mental stress.
  In neuropaths, these mental struggles are the worst things that could
  occur, for they tend to make permanent the states we are trying to
  cure.</p>

  <p>The most serious results of masturbation are moral not physical. Loss
  of will-power, self-reliance, presence of mind, reasoning power, memory,
  courage, idealism, and self-control; mental and physical debility,
  laziness, a diseased fondness for the opposite <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> sex, and in later
  years, some degree of impotence or sterility, are its commoner
  results.</p>

  <p>Teach <i>your</i> child, therefore, not from fear of physical harm,
  but because you wish him to be one of those fortunate few who live and
  die "gentlemen unafraid", because they had wise parents.</p>

  <p>Let the mother instruct a girl, the father a boy, and not leave so
  vital a matter to an unsuitable pamphlet.</p>

  <p>Buy one of the many "Knowledge for Boys or Girls" books and read it
  carefully.</p>

  <p>Having made sure you can convey a simple account of the wonders of
  reproduction, and that you have rooted out the idea that sex is something
  to be apologized for, see the child and tell him it is time he learned of
  his private parts, as manhood draws near.</p>

  <p>Then, speaking in a quiet, unembarrassed way, deliver your little
  homily, all the time insisting on the marvel, the romance, the poetry and
  the beauty of the sex. Let chivalry be your text, not fear, and repeat
  the Squire's sound parting advice to Tom Brown:</p>

  <blockquote>"Never listen to or say things you would not have your mother
  or sister hear."</blockquote>

  <p>Give a clear and complete description in simple words of the mechanism
  and marvel of reproduction, for half-knowledge generates a prurient
  curiosity about the other sex, thus defeating the very end you have so
  earnestly striven for.</p>

  <p>Purity not impurity should be your text, and you should only refer to
  masturbation as a harmful habit, which should not be contracted.</p>

  <p>Warn them to</p>

  <blockquote>"Keep the heart with all diligence, for out of it are the
  issues of life!"</blockquote>

  <p>by turning their thoughts instantly and determinedly <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> away from
  sex ideas when they arise, as they <i>will</i> arise, time and again. It
  is useless to try <i>not</i> to think of them, the child must instantly
  turn its thoughts to to <i>something else</i>, for one who cannot stamp
  out a spark will not subdue a fiercely-raging conflagration.</p>

  <p>Babies should not be carelessly caressed, and a fretful infant must
  never be soothed by playing with the genitals, as is done innocently by
  some mothers and nurses, and by others from motives more questionable.
  Freud showed that there are subconscious sexual desires in infants, which
  die out until reanimated at puberty in Nature's own way. If exaggerated
  by exuberant fondling, they gather force in the dark corners of the mind,
  and are later manifested in morbid sexual or mental perversity.</p>

  <p>If you have good grounds for believing the habit has already been
  contracted, enlist medical advice. A great factor in the successful
  treatment of self-abuse is early recognition, and, after the unhygienic
  nature of the habit has carefully been pointed out, the child's sense of
  honour should be invoked.</p>

  <p>Without further reference to the matter, try to become your child's
  confidant, for he will have to fight fires within and foes without. See
  that his time is filled with healthy sport and play, and ennoble his
  ideas with talk, books and plays which lay stress on chivalry and
  manliness. Give him plain food, tepid douches, and a firm bed with light,
  fairly warm clothing. Get him up reasonably early in the morning, and let
  him play until he is "dog-tired" at night.</p>

  <p>Let children rub shoulders with others, keep them from highly exciting
  tales, let them read but little, and train them to be observant of
  external objects all the time.</p>

  <p>Neuropaths develop very early sexually, and contract bad habits in the
  endeavour to still their unruly passions; with them, the future is darker
  <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[pg
  114]</span> than with the normal child, and the parent who neglects his
  duty may justly be held accountable for what happens to his child or his
  child's children.</p>

  <p>Puberty is always a critical period in epilepsy, many cases commencing
  at this time, while in a number, fits commence in infancy, cease during
  childhood, and recommence at puberty, the baneful stimulus of
  masturbation being undoubtedly a factor in many of these cases.</p>

<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>

<hr />

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXIII</p>

<h3>WORK AND PLAY</h3>

  <p>Although most people would assume that epileptics are unable to follow
  a trade, there is hardly an occupation from medicine to mining, from
  agriculture to acting, that does not include epileptics among its
  votaries.</p>

  <p>Outdoor occupations involving but little mental work or responsibility
  are best, but unfortunately just those which promise excitement and
  change are those which appeal to the neuropath.</p>

  <p>A light, clean, manual trade should be chosen, and those that mean
  work in stuffy factories, amid whirring wheels and harmful fumes, using
  dangerous tools, or climbing ladders, must be avoided.</p>

  <p>For the fairly robust, gardening or farming are good occupations, such
  workers getting pure air, continuous exercise, and little brain-work.
  Wood-working trades are good, if dangerous tools like circular saws are
  left to others.</p>

  <p>For the frail neuropath with a fair education, drawing, modelling,
  book-keeping, and similar semi-sedentary work may do. Other patients
  might be suited as shoemakers, stonemasons, painters, plumbers or
  domestic servants, so long as they always work on the ground.</p>

  <p>Some work is essential; better an unsuitable occupation than none at
  all, for the downward tendency of the complaint is sufficiently marked
  without the victim becoming an idler. Work gives stability.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy limits patients to a humble sphere, and <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> though
  this is hard to a man of talent, it is but one of many hard lessons, the
  hardest being to realize clearly his own limitations.</p>

  <p>If seizures be frequent, the ignorant often refuse to work with a
  victim, who can only procure odd jobs, in which case he should strive to
  find home-work, at which he can work slowly and go to bed when he feels
  ill. A card in the window, a few handbills distributed in the district,
  judicious canvassing, and perhaps the patronage of the local doctor and
  clergy may procure enough work to pay expenses and leave a little over,
  for the essential thing is to occupy the mind and exercise the body, not
  to make money.</p>

  <p>Very few trades can be plied at home and many swindlers obtain money
  under the pretence of finding such employment, charging an excessive
  price for an "outfit", and then refusing to buy the output, usually on
  the pretext that it is inferior. Envelope-addressing, postcard-painting
  and machine-knitting have all been abused to this end.</p>

  <p>An auto-knitter seems to offer possibilities, but victims must
  investigate offers carefully.</p>

  <p>Photography is easy. A cheap outfit will make excellent postcards,
  modern methods having got rid of the dark room and much of the mess, and
  postcard-size prints can be pasted on various attractive mounts.</p>

  <p>If the work is done slowly, and in a good light, and the patient has
  an aptitude for it, ticket-writing is pleasant. Among small shopkeepers
  there is a constant demand for good, plainly printed tickets at a
  reasonable price.</p>

  <p>On an allotment near home vegetables and poultry might be raised, an
  important contribution to the household, and one which removes the stigma
  of being a non-earner.</p>

  <p>The mental discipline furnished by this home-work is invaluable,
  Neuropaths, especially if untrained, are <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> unable to
  concentrate their attention on any matter for long, and do their work
  hastily to get it finished. When they find that to sell the work it must
  be done slowly and perfectly they have made a great advance towards
  training their minds to concentrate. Their weak inhibitory power is thus
  strengthened with happy results all round.</p>

  <p>When the work and the weather permit, work should be done outdoors,
  and when done indoors windows should be opened, and, if possible, an
  empty or sparsely-furnished bedroom chosen for the work.</p>

  <p><b>Recreations</b>. These offer a freer choice, but those causing
  fatigue or excitement must be avoided, for patients who have no energy to
  waste need only fresh air and quiet exercise.</p>

  <p>Manual are better than mental relaxations. Dancing is unsuitable,
  swimming dangerous, athletics too tiring and exciting. Bowls, croquet,
  golf, walking, quoits, billiards, parlour games and quiet gymnastics
  without apparatus are good, if played in moderation and much more gently
  than normal people play them. Play is recreation only so long as a
  pastime is not turned into a business. When a player is annoyed at
  losing, though he loses naught save his own temper, any game has ceased
  to be recreative.</p>

<h3>HEREDITY</h3>

  <blockquote>"Man is composed of characters derived from pre-existing
  germ-cells, over which he has no control. Be they good, bad, or
  indifferent, these factors are his from his ancestry; the possession of
  them is to him a matter of neither blame nor praise, but of necessity.
  They are inevitable."&mdash;Leighton.</blockquote>

  <p>The body is composed of myriads of cells of <i>protoplasm</i>, in each
  of which, is a <i>nucleus</i> which contains the factors of the
  hereditary nature of the cell. In growth, the nucleus splits in half, a
  wall grows between and each new cell has half the original factors,</p>

  <p>Female <i>ovum</i> and male <i>sperm</i> (the cells concerned with
  reproduction) divide, thus losing half their factors, and when brought
  together by sexual intercourse form a <i>germ-cell</i> having an equal
  number of factors from mother and father.</p>

  <p>How these factors are mingled&mdash;whether shuffled like two packs of
  cards, or mixed like two paints&mdash;we do not know. If two opposite
  factors are brought together, one must lie dormant. The offspring may be
  male or female, tall or short; it cannot be both, nor will there be a
  mixture. <i>This rule only applies to clearly defined factors.</i></p>

  <p>We are <i>made by</i> the <i>germ-plasm</i> handed down to us by our
  ancestors; in turn we pass it on to our children, <i>unaltered</i>, but
  mixed with our partner's plasm.</p>

  <p>"The Dead dominate the Living" for our physical <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> and mental
  inheritance is a mosaic made by our ancestors.</p>

  <p>Variations which may or may not be inheritable do arise spontaneously,
  we know not how, and by variations all living things evolve.</p>

  <p>A child resembles his parents more than strangers, not because they
  made cells "after their own image" but because both he and they got their
  factors from the same source.</p>

  <p>Man's physical and mental, and the <i>basis</i> of his moral,
  qualities depend entirely on the types of ancestral plasm combined in
  marriage. Man may control his environment; his heritage is immutable. To
  suppress an undesirable trait the germ-cell must unite with one that has
  never shown it&mdash;one from a sound stock. An unsuitable mating in a
  later generation, however, may bring it out again (for factors are
  indestructible), and the individual showing it will have "reverted to
  ancestral type".</p>

  <p>To give an instance: Does the son of a drunkard inherit a tendency to
  drink? No! The father is alcoholic because he lacks control, consequent
  upon the factors which make for control having been absent from his
  germ-plasm. He passes on this lack; if the mother does the same, the
  defect occurs&mdash;in a worse form&mdash;in the son. If the mother gives
  a control factor, the son may be unstable or <i>apparently</i> stable,
  this depending entirely on chance, but if the mother's plasm contains a
  <i>strong</i> control-factor, the defect will lie dormant in her son, who
  will have self-control, though if he marries the wrong woman he will have
  weak-willed children.</p>

  <p>If the son becomes a toper, therefore, it is because he, like his
  father before him, was born with a defect&mdash;weak control&mdash;which
  might have made of him a drug-fiend, a tobacco-slave, a rake, or a
  criminal; in his home drink would naturally be the temptation nearest
  <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[pg
  120]</span> to hand, and he would show his lack of control in
  drunkenness.</p>

  <p>The way a lily-seed is treated makes a vast difference to the plant
  which arises. If sown in poor soil, and neglected, a dwarf, sickly plant
  will result; if sown in rich soil, and given every care that enthusiasm,
  money and skill can suggest or procure, the result will be
  magnificent.</p>

  <p>So with man. A well-nourished mother, free from care and disease, may
  have a finer child than a half-starved woman, crushed by worry and work,
  but neither starvation nor nourishment alter the inborn character of the
  child.</p>

  <p>The <i>body-cells</i> are greatly changed by disease, poison, injury,
  and overwork, but these changes are not passed on, and despite the
  influence of disease from time immemorial, the <i>germ-cell</i> produces
  the same man as in ancient days. Without this fixity of character, this
  "continuity of the germ-plasm", "man" would cease to be, for the
  descendants of changeable cells would be of infinite variety, having
  fixity of neither form nor character.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy, hysteria and neurasthenia are all outward signs of defect in
  the germ-plasm, and so they (or a predisposition to them) can be passed
  on, and inherited.</p>

  <p>If a man shows a certain character, his plasm, had, and has, the
  causative factor. He may have received it from <i>both</i> his parents,
  when it will be <i>strong</i>, or from one only, when it will be
  <i>normal</i>. If he have it not, it is absent. The same applies to the
  plasm of the woman he mates, so there are six possible combinations, with
  results according to "Mendel's Law."</p>

  <p><i>All</i> the children will not inherit a taint unless <i>both</i>
  parents possess it, but, however strong one parent be, if the other is
  tainted, <i>none</i> of the children can be absolutely clean, but will
  show the taint, weak, strong, or dormant. This means that neuropathy will
  recur&mdash;and <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> that it has previously
  occurred&mdash;in the same family, unless there be continual mating into
  sound stocks. If there is continual mating into bad stocks, it will recur
  frequently and in severe forms. All intermediate stages may occur,
  depending entirely on the qualities of the combining stocks.</p>

  <p>From this we shall expect, in the same stock, signs of neuropathic
  taint other than the three diseases dealt with here, and these we get;
  for alcoholism, criminality, chorea, deformities, insanity and other
  brain diseases, are not infrequent among the relatives of a neuropath,
  showing that the family germ-plasm is unsound.</p>

  <p>Epilepsy, one symptom of taint, is more or less interchangeable with
  other defects; the taint, as a whole, is an inheritable unit whose
  inheritance will appear as any one of many defects. This is shown by the
  fact that very few epileptics have an epileptic parent. Starr's analysis
  of 700 cases of epilepsy emphasizes this point.</p>

  <p>As medicine and surgery cannot add or delete plasmic factors, the only
  way to stamp out neuropathy in severe forms would be to sterilize victims
  by X-rays. This would be painless, would protect the race and not
  interfere with personal or even with sexual liberty. In fifty years such
  diseases would be almost extinct, and those arising from accident or the
  chance union of dormant factors in apparently normal people could easily
  be dealt with.</p>

<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>

  <p>There are 100,000 epileptics in Great Britain, and as <i>all</i> their
  children carry a taint which tends to reappear as epilepsy in a later
  generation <i>the number of epileptics doubles every forty years</i>. We
  protect these unfortunates against others; why not posterity against
  them?</p>

  <p>Neuropaths must pass on <i>some</i> defect; therefore, though victims
  may marry, <i>no neuropath has a right to have children</i>.</p>

<h3>CHARACTER</h3>

  <blockquote>"All men are not equal, either at birth or by training.
  Nature gives each of us the neural clay, with its properties of
  pliability and of receiving impressions; nurture moulds and fashions it,
  until a <i>character</i> is formed, a mingling of innate disposition and
  acquired powers. But clay will be clay to the end; you cannot expect it
  to be marble."&mdash;Thomson &amp; Geddes.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge."&mdash;King
  John.</blockquote>

  <p>It is essential that attendants, relatives, and friends carefully
  study the character of neuropaths, and recognize clearly how abnormal it
  is, for untold misery is caused by judging neuropaths by normal
  standards.</p>

  <p>Patients are often harshly treated because others regard the victim of
  defective inhibition as having gone deliberately to work, through wicked
  perversity and pure wilfulness, to make himself a nuisance, to persist in
  being a nuisance, and to refuse to be other than a nuisance, rather than
  exercise what more fortunate men are pleased to term self-control.</p>

  <p>Character is usually appraised as "good" or "evil" by the nature of a
  man's actions, the assumption being made that he can control his impulses
  if he be so minded.</p>

  <p>This is not so. "Good" and "evil" are only relative terms. What one
  man thinks "evil", a second holds "good", while a third is not
  influenced.</p>

<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>

  <p>Now the performance of the act judged is directed by the performer's
  brain, the constitution of which was pre-determined by the germ-plasm
  from which he arose, so that <i>the basis of character is
  inherited</i>.</p>

  <p>The moral sense is the last evolved and least stable attribute of the
  last evolved and least stable of our organs, the brain; and brains are
  born, not made to order. To blame a man for having weak control&mdash;a
  sick will&mdash;is as unreasonable as to blame him for a cleft palate or
  a squint. The "good" people who jog so quietly through life little reck
  how much they owe their ancestors, from whom they received stability.</p>

  <p>These tendencies represent the total material for building character.
  Training and environment can only nourish good tendencies and give bad
  ones no encouragement to grow gigantic.</p>

  <p>If training and environment alone formed character, then children
  reared together would be of similar disposition; by no means the case.
  Similarly, if external influences altered inborn tendencies, then, not
  only would the evil man be totally reformed by strong inducements to
  virtue, but strong inducements to vice would lead totally astray the good
  man, for "good" is no <i>stronger</i> than "evil", both being attributes
  of mind.</p>

  <p>In mind as in body, from the moment he is conceived to the moment his
  dust rests in the tomb, man is directed by immutable laws, though he is
  not simply a machine directed by impulses over which he has no control.
  There is real meaning in "strong will" and "weak will" will being a
  tendency to deliberate before and be steadfast in action, a tendency
  which varies immensely in different people. The fallacy of "free will"
  lies in assuming that every one has this tendency equally developed,
  making character a mere matter of saying "Yes!" and "No!" without
  reference to the individual's mental make-up.</p>

  <p>Deliberate, persistent wickedness implies a strong <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> will, just
  what neuropaths lack. A man of weak will can never be a very good nor yet
  a very bad man. He will be very good at times, very bad at times, and
  neutral at times, but neither for long; before sudden impulses, whether
  good or bad, neuropaths are largely powerless.</p>

  <p>The many perversities of a neuropath are not deliberately put forth of
  his "free will" to annoy both himself and others, for the neuropath
  inherits his weak-control no less than his large hands.</p>

  <p>Friends <i>must</i> remember they are dealing with a person whose
  <i>nature</i> it is to "go off half-cock", and who cannot be normal "if
  he likes". The neuropath, young or old, says what he "thinks" <i>without
  thinking</i>, that is he says what he <i>feels</i>, and acts hastily
  without weighing consequences.</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p><i>Cassius</i>: Have you not love enough to bear with me,</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<hr />

  <p>One cannot detail the effects of neuropathy on character, when its
  victims include madmen, sexual perverts, idiots, criminals, imbeciles,
  prostitutes, humble but honest citizens, common nuisances, invalids of
  many kinds, misanthropists, designers, enthusiasts, composers,
  communists, reformers, authors, artists, agitators, statesmen, poets,
  prophets, priests and kings.</p>

  <p>Very mild epilepsy&mdash;from one fit a year to one in several
  years&mdash;instead of hindering, seems rather to help mentality, and
  many geniuses have been epileptic. These talented victims, are less rare
  than the public <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> suppose, owing to the jealous care
  with which symptoms of this disease are guarded. Socrates, Julius Cæsar,
  Mahomet, Joan of Arc, Peter the Great, Napoleon, Byron, Swinburne, and
  Dostoieffsky are but a few among many great names in the world of art,
  religion and statecraft. Epileptic princes, kings and kinglets who have
  achieved unenviable notoriety might be named by scores, Wilhelm II being
  the most notable of modern times.</p>

  <p>This brilliant mentality is always accompanied by instability, and
  usually by marked disability in other ways. The success of these men
  often depends on an ability to view things from a new, quaint or queer
  standpoint, which appeals to their more normal fellows.</p>

  <p>In matters that require great fertility, a quick grasp, ready wit, and
  brilliant but not sustained mental effort, numerous neuropaths excel. In
  things calling for calm, well-balanced judgment, or stern effort to
  conquer unforseen difficulties, they fail utterly.</p>

  <p>Subtle in debate, they are but stumbling-blocks in council; brilliant
  in conception, they fail in execution; fanciful designers, they are not
  "builders of bridges". They are boastful, sparkling, inventive, witty,
  garrulous, vain and supersensitive, outraging their friends by the
  extravagance of their schemes; embarrassing their enemies by the subtlety
  of their intrigues.</p>

  <p>They wing on exuberant imagination from height to height, but the
  small boulders of difficulty trip them up, for they are hopelessly
  unpractical; they have neither strength of purpose nor fortitude, and
  their best-laid schemes are always frustrated at the critical moment, by
  either the incurable blight of vacillation, or by the determination to
  amplify their scheme ere it has proved successful, sacrificing probable
  results for visionary improvements.</p>

  <p>Great and cunning strategists while fortune smiles, <!-- Page 127
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> they are
  impotent to direct a retreat, but flee before the fury they ought to
  face. They rarely have personal courage, but are timid, conciliatory and
  vacillating just when bravery, sternness, and determination are needed;
  furious, obstinate and reckless, when gentleness, diplomacy and wisdom
  would carry their point.</p>

  <p>They are ready to forgive when there is magnanimity, vainglory and
  probably folly in forgiveness, but will not overlook the most trivial
  affront when there is every reason for so doing. They have brain, but not
  ballast, and their whole life is usually a lopsided effort to "play to
  the gallery".</p>

  <p>In poetry and literature, fancy has free play, and they often succeed,
  sometimes rising to sublime heights; usually in the depiction of the
  whimsical, the wonderful, the sardonic, the bizarre, the monstrous, or
  the frankly impossible. They are not architects as much as jugglers of
  words, and descriptive writing from an acute angle of vision is their
  forte. They sometimes succeed as artists or composers, for in these
  spheres they need not elaborate their ideas in such clean-cut detail, but
  many who might succeed in these branches have not sufficient strength of
  purpose to do the preliminary "spadework".</p>

  <p>They have too many talents, too many differing inclinations, too much
  impetuosity, too much vanity, too little concentration and will-power,
  and they fail in ordinary walks of life from the lack of resolution to
  lay the foundations necessary to successful mediocrity.</p>

  <p>No greater obstacle to progress exists than the reputation for talent
  which this class acquire on a flimsy basis of superficial brilliance in
  conversation or a penchant for witty repartee. They are self-opinionated
  and egoistical, with a conceit and assurance out of all proportion to
  their abilities. Their mental perspective is distorted and they are
  conspicuous for their obstinacy. In conversation they are prolix and <!--
  Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
  pretentious, and they often contract religious mania, in which their
  actions by no means accord with their protestations, for they have very
  elementary notions of right and wrong, or no notions at all.</p>

  <p>Often they are precocious, but untruthful, cruel, and vicious; the
  despair of relatives, friends, and teachers. They combine unusual
  frankness with an audacity and impulsiveness that is very misleading, for
  below this show of fire and power there is no stability.</p>

  <p>Their character is a tangle of mercurial moods, the neuropath being
  passionate but loving, sullen one moment, overflowing with sentimental
  affection the next, vicious a little while later, quick to unreasoning
  anger, and as quick to repent or forgive, obstinate but easily led,
  versatile but inconstant, noble and mean by turns, full of contradictions
  and contrasts, at best a brilliant failure, vain, deaf to advice or
  reproof, having in his ailing frame the virtues and vices of a dozen
  normal men.</p>

  <p>Mercier aptly describes him:</p>

  <blockquote>"There is a large class of persons who are often of acute and
  nimble intelligence, in general ability equal to or above the average, of
  an active, bustling disposition, but who are utterly devoid of industry.
  For by industry we mean steady persistence in a continuous employment in
  spite of monotony and distastefulness; an employment that is followed at
  the cost of present gratification for the sake of future benefit. Of such
  self-sacrifice these persons are incapable. They are always busy, but
  their activity is recreative, in the sense that it is congenial to them,
  and from it they derive immediate gratification. As soon as they tire of
  what they are doing, as soon as their occupation ceases to be in itself
  attractive it is relinquished for something else, <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> which in its turn
  is abandoned as soon as it becomes tedious.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Such people form a well-characterized class: they are
  clever; they readily acquire accomplishments which do not need great
  application; and agreeably to the recreative character of their
  occupations, their natures are well developed on the artistic side. They
  draw, paint, sing, play, write verses and make various pretty things with
  easy dexterity. Their lack of industry prevents them ever mastering the
  technique of any art; they have artistic tastes, but are always
  amateurs.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"With the vice of busy idleness they display other vices. The
  same inability to forgo immediate enjoyment, at whatever cost, shows
  itself in other acts. They are nearly always spendthrifts, usually
  drunkards, often sexually dissolute. Next to their lack of industry,
  their most conspicuous quality is their incurable mendacity. Their
  readiness, their resources, their promptitude, the elaborate
  circumstantiality of their lies are astonishing. The copiousness and
  efficiency of their excuses for failing to do what they have undertaken
  would convince anyone who had no experience of their capabilities in this
  way.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Withal, they are excellent company, pleasant companions,
  good-natured, easy-going, and urbane. Their self-conceit is inordinate,
  and remains undiminished in spite of repeated failures in the most
  important affairs of life. They see themselves fall immeasurably behind
  those who are admittedly their inferiors in cleverness, yet they are not
  only cheery and content, but their confidence in their own powers and
  general superiority to other people remains undiminished.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"<i>The lack of self-restraint is plainly an inborn
  character</i>, for it may show itself in but one member of the family
  brought up in exactly the same circumstances as other members who do not
  show any such peculiarity. The victim is born with <!-- Page 130 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> one important
  mental faculty defective, precisely as another may be born with
  hare-lip."</blockquote>

  <p>In neuropaths the mental mechanism of <i>projection</i>, which we all
  show, is often marked.</p>

  <p>Any personal shortcoming, being repugnant to us causes self-reproach,
  which we avoid by "projecting" the fault (unconsciously) on some one
  else.</p>

  <p>Readers should get "The Idiot" by Fedor Dostoieffsky, an epileptic
  genius who saw that for those like him, happiness could be got through
  peace of mind alone, and not in the cut-throat struggle for worldly
  success. He projected his stabler self into Prince Muishkin, the idiot,
  and every one of the six hundred odd pages of this amazing description of
  a neuropathic nation is stamped with the hall-mark of genius.</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE</h3>

  <blockquote>"Between two beings so complex and so diverse as man and
  woman, the whole of life is not too long for them to know one another
  well, and to learn to love one another
  worthily."&mdash;Comte.</blockquote>

  <p>No neuropath should have children, but marriage is good in mild cases,
  for neuropaths are benefited by sympathetic companionship, and their
  sexual passions are so strong that they must be gratified, by marriage,
  prostitution, or unnaturally.</p>

  <p>Bernard Shaw's sneer&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>"Marriage is popular because it combines the maximum of
  temptation with the maximum of opportunity"&mdash;</blockquote>

  <p>is justifiable, though the "maximum of opportunity" is better than a
  maximum of unnatural devices to satisfy and intensify normal and abnormal
  cravings.</p>

  <p>There is a popular belief that an epileptic girl is cured by
  pregnancy, a state that ought never to occur.</p>

  <p>The lack of sex-education causes millions of miserable marriages.
  Sexual desire is cultivated out of all proportion to other desires, the
  will cannot control the desire to relieve an intolerable sense of
  discomfort, and men eagerly seize the first chance of being able to
  satisfy these fierce cravings at pleasure.</p>

  <p>If sex were treated sensibly it would develop into a <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> powerful
  instead of an overpowering appetite, and reason would have some say in
  the choice of a life-partner.</p>

  <p>A neuropath needs a calm, even-tempered, "motherly" wife. For him,
  gentleness, self-control, sound common sense and domestic virtues are
  superior to wit or beauty. Unfortunately, contrary to public belief,
  people are attracted by their like, not by their opposites. The
  sensitive, refined neuropath finds the normal person insipid and dull;
  the normal person is rendered uncomfortable by the morbid caprices of the
  neuropath.</p>

  <p>There must be no disparity of age, for at the menopause the woman no
  longer seeks the sexual embrace, and if her husband be young
  unfaithfulness ensues. Not only that, but she, knowing, probably to her
  sorrow, how rarely the hopes of youth mature, cannot take a keen interest
  in his ambitions like a younger woman, or fire his dying enthusiasm at
  difficult parts of the way. If he be his wife's senior he will be as
  little able to appreciate her ideas and habits.</p>

  <p>An excitable, volatile, garrulous, "neighbourly" woman, or one who can
  do little save strum on the piano or make embroidery as intricate as it
  is useless, means divorce or murder. For him, sweetness, gentleness,
  self-control, sound common sense, shrewdness, and domestic virtues are
  incomparably superior to any mental brilliance or physical comeliness. He
  needs a "homely" woman, and should remember that no banking account can
  match a sweet, womanly personality, and no charms compare to a sunny
  heart, and an ability steadfastly to "see the silver lining".</p>

  <p>He must on no account marry a woman in indifferent health, for under
  the strain of her husband's infirmity the woman, who if she were well
  would be a help, is a source of expense, worry and friction.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the woman who receives a proposal <!-- Page 133
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> from a
  neuropath, be he ever so gifted, has grave grounds for pausing, though it
  is hard to counter the specious arguments of one who may be "a man o'
  pairts", a witty companion and an ardent lover. It is doubtful if a
  neuropath is ever permeated by a steadfast emotion, for all his emotions
  are fierce but unstable, the love of an inconsistent man being ten times
  more ardent than that of a faithful one, <i>while it lasts</i>.</p>

  <blockquote>"You can't marry a man without taking his faults with his
  virtues,"</blockquote>

  <p>and love must be strong enough to stand, not storms alone, but the
  minor miseries of life, the incessant pinpricks, the dreary days when the
  smile abroad has become the scowl at home. At best, her husband will be
  capricious, hard to please, and though rabidly jealous without cause, at
  the same time very partial to the attractions of other women. He usually
  needs the attention of the whole household, which his varying health and
  moods keep in a mingled state of anxious solicitude and smouldering
  resentment.</p>

  <p>His infirmity may mean a very secluded and humdrum life. She will have
  to make home an ever-cheery place, an ideal that means hard work and
  self-sacrifice through lonesome years in which her nobility will be
  unrecognized and unrewarded.</p>

  <p>A woman fond of amusements and sport, and having many acquaintances
  would find this unbearable. Any happiness in marriage to a neuropath is
  largely dependent on the self-sacrifice of the wife.</p>

  <p>Should marriage occur, the wife must judiciously curb her husband's
  passions without driving him to other women by coldness, a problem which
  is often solved by separation. The suggestion should never come from her,
  and the more she can curb his ardour by tactful suggestion, the healthier
  will he and the <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> happier will she be, for nothing
  causes such an irritable, nervous state as excessive coitus.</p>

  <p>She will often have to give way in this matter, but must be firm on
  the necessity for preventing conception, for she can only bear a tainted
  child; her responsibility is great, and she must <i>insist</i> that her
  husband use those simple methods which prevent conception, thereby ending
  in himself one branch of a worthless tree. This must be done at any cost,
  for her happiness is nought compared to the welfare of future
  generations. Bitter though it be that no fruit of her womb may call her
  blessèd, it is less bitter than hearing her children call themselves
  accursèd.</p>

  <blockquote>"So many severall wayes are we plagued and punished for our
  father's defaultes, that it is the greatest part of our felicity to be
  well born, and it were happy for humankind if only such parentes as are
  sounde of body and mind should be suffered to marry. An Husbandman will
  sow none but the choicest seed upon his lande; he will not reare a bull
  nor an horse, except he be right shapen in all his parts, or permit him
  to cover a mare, except he be well assured of his breed; we make choice
  of the neatest kine, and keep the best dogs, and how careful then should
  we be in begetting our children? In former tyme, some countreys have been
  so chary in this behalf, so stern, that if a child were crooked or
  deformed in body or mind, they made it away; so did the Indians of old,
  and many other well gouverned Commonwealths, according to the discipline
  of those times. Heretofore in Scotland, if any were visited with the
  falling sickness, madness, goute, leprosie, or any such dangerous
  disease, which was like to be propagated from the father to the son, he
  was instantly gelded; a woman kept from all company of men; and if by
  chance, having some such disease, she was found to be with child <!--
  Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>
  she with her brood were buried alive; and this was done for the common
  good, lest the whole nation should be injured or corrupted. A severe
  doom, you will say, and not to be used among Christians. Yet to be more
  looked into than it is. For now, by our too much facility in this kind,
  in giving way to all to marry that will, too much liberty and indulgence
  in tolerating all sorts, there is a vast confusion of hereditary
  diseases; no family secure, no man almost free from some grievous
  infirmity or other. Our generation is corrupt, we have so many weak
  persons, both in body and mind, many feral diseases raging among us,
  crazed families: our fathers bad, and we like to be worse."</blockquote>

  <p>Her husband will want much petting and caressing, and she must foster
  his love by lavishing on him much fondness, and ignoring amours as but
  the mischievous results of his restless, intriguing mind.</p>

  <p>She must let him see in an affectionate way that she can let others
  enjoy his company betimes, secure in the knowledge that she is supreme in
  his affections&mdash;cajolery that flatters his overweening vanity, and
  rarely fails.</p>

  <p>In anger, as in every other emotion, the neuropath is as transient as
  he is truculent. A trivial "tiff" will make him blaze up in ungovernable
  rage and say most abominable and untruthful things; even utter violent
  threats. He will not admit he is wrong, but like a spoilt child must be
  kissed and coaxed into a good temper, first with himself and with others
  next.</p>

  <p>At one moment he is in a perfect paroxysm of fury; five minutes later
  he is passionately embracing the luckless object of it and vowing eternal
  devotion. In a further five he has forgotten all his remarks and would
  hotly deny he used the vexing statements imputed to him.</p>

<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span>

  <p>Epileptics are morbidly sensitive, and reference to their malady must
  be avoided. Victims are intensely suspicious, and a pitying look will
  reveal to them the fact that some outsider knows all about the
  jealously-guarded skeleton. Resentment, distrust and misery follow such
  an exposure, for every innocent look is then translated into a
  contemptuous glance, and the victim detects slights undreamt of in any
  brain save his own.</p>

  <p>Unless seizures are severe, no one should be called in; if they cause
  alarm, ask a discreet male neighbour to assist when necessary, leaving
  when the convulsions abate so that the victim is not aware of his
  presence. Avoid the word "fit" and "epilepsy", and if reference to the
  attack be necessary, refer to it as a "faint" or "turn".</p>

  <p>Living with a man liable to have a fit at inopportune times is a
  tremendous strain, and the soundest advice one can offer a woman thinking
  of marrying such a one is Punch's&mdash;"DON'T!"</p>

  <p>We have painted the black side, but, tactfully managed, a neuropath
  will merge in the kindest of husbands, the most constant of lovers. The
  wife need not be unhappy. Tactless, masterful women will fail, but no one
  is more easily led, particularly in the way he should not go, than a
  neuropath.</p>

  <p>A man with definite views of his own value will not be successful foil
  for "mother-in-lawing", nor remain quiet under the interference of
  relatives, who should remember that well-meaning intentions do not
  justify meddling actions.</p>

  <p>Many a neuropath led a useful life and gained success in a profession,
  solely because his wife tactfully kept him in the path, watched his
  health, prevented him frittering away his gifts in many pursuits or
  useless repining, and made home a real haven.</p>

  <p>When the yolk seems unbearably heavy, the wife <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> should remember her
  husband has to bear the primary, she only the reflected misery, for the
  limitations neuropathy puts on every activity and ambition, social and
  professional, are frightfully depressing.</p>

  <p>In spite of his peevishness her husband may be trying hard to minimize
  his defects and be a reasonable, helpful companion.</p>

  <div class="noflo">
    <div class="nofblk">
      <p>"Judge not the working of his brain,</p>
      <p>And of his heart thou can'st not see;</p>

      <p>In God's pure light may only be</p>

  <p>Magnify his virtues and be tenderly charitable to his many frailties,
  for he is "not as other men" and too well he knows it. Love at its best

  <blockquote>"What greater reward can thou desire than the proud

  but unspeakably holy memories at the moment of eternal
  parting?"</blockquote>

<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>

  <p>Surely, none!</p>

  <p>We have considered the mournful case of a wife with a neuropathic
  husband, and must now say a few words about the truly distressing fate of
  a husband afflicted with a neuropathic wife, for neuropathy in its
  unpleasant consequences to others is far worse in woman than in man.</p>

  <p>A man is at work all day, and his mind is perforce distracted from his
  woes, and, though he retails them at night to the home circle, they get
  so used to them as to disregard them, proffering a few words of
  agreement, sympathy or scorn quite automatically.</p>

  <p>With women the distraction of work is not so complete, for housework
  can be neglected, there are always neighbours and friends to listen to
  tales of woe and thus generate a very harmful self-pity, and women are
  not content to enumerate their woes, but demand the attention and
  sympathy of all listeners.</p>

  <p>Many of the facts in the foregoing parts of this chapter apply with
  equal force to both sexes, but women being usually more patient, tactful,
  resigned and self-sacrificing than men, can&mdash;and often
  do&mdash;alleviate the lot of the male neuropath; whereas the absence of
  these qualities in the average man means that he aggravates, instead of
  alleviating, the lot of any female neuropath to whom he may be
  wedded.</p>

  <p>Having taken her "for better, for worse" he will find her irritating,
  unreasonable, and unfitted to shoulder domestic responsibilities. Her
  likes and dislikes, fickle fancies, unreasonable prejudices, selfish ways
  will cause trouble; he must be prepared for misunderstandings and feuds
  with relatives and friends, and on reaching home tired and worried, he is
  like to find his house in disorder, be assailed by a tale of woe, and
  perhaps find that his wife's vagaries have involved him in a tiff with
  neighbours.</p>

  <p>She will be fretful, exacting, impatient, and given <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> to ready
  tears. Sensitive to the last degree, she will see slights where none are
  intended, and a chiding word, a reproachful look, or a weary sigh will
  mean a fit of temper or depression.</p>

  <p>Not only are men less gifted for "managing" women than vice versa, but
  women are far less susceptible to tactful management than men; a man,
  like a dog, can be led almost anywhere with a little dragging at the
  chain and growling now and then; a woman, like a cat, is more likely to
  spit, swear, and scratch than come along.</p>

  <p>Consequently, it is almost impossible to suggest means of obtaining
  relief to one who has been luckless enough to marry, or be married by, a
  neuropathic woman.</p>

  <p>If the husband sympathize, the condition will but be aggravated;
  medicinal measures will only increase, instead of diminishing, the number
  of symptoms; indifference will procure such an exhibition as will both
  prove its uselessness and ensure the attention craved.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER XXVII</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

  <p>To sum up: we have learnt that Epilepsy is a very ancient disease due
  to some instability of the brain, in which convulsions are a common but
  not invariable symptom.</p>

  <p>Its actual cause is unknown. Heredity plays a big part, but there are
  secondary causes beside factors which excite attacks.</p>

  <p>Various methods and drugs to prevent seizures have a limited use.</p>

  <p>First-aid treatment consists solely in preventing the victim
  sustaining any injury.</p>

  <p>Neurasthenia is a disease due to nerve-exhaustion and poisoning from
  overwork and worry. Its symptoms are many, but fatigue and irritability
  are the chief.</p>

  <p>Hysteria is an obstinate, functional, nervous disease in which the
  patient acts in an abnormal manner, which is highly provoking to other
  individuals.</p>

  <p>The cure for hysteria and neurasthenia is solely hygienic, and depends
  mainly on the patient.</p>

  <p>The first step towards health consists in getting any slight organic
  defects remedied.</p>

  <p>Digestion is often poorly performed.</p>

  <p>This must be remedied by thorough mastication and rational
  dieting.</p>

  <p>Constipation is very inimical to neuropaths, and must be remedied.</p>

  <p>Patients must pay careful attention to general hygiene.</p>

<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>

  <p>Insomnia is exhausting and must be conquered.</p>

  <p>The effects of imagination are profound.</p>

  <p>Suggestion treatment overcomes imaginary ills.</p>

  <p>Drug treatment is either of very limited utility, or frankly
  useless.</p>

  <p>Patent medicines are never of the slightest use.</p>

  <p>The rational training of neuropathic children is a very difficult but
  essential task.</p>

  <p>Puberty and adolescence are very critical times.</p>

  <p>Occupations and recreations must be wisely chosen.</p>

  <p>Heredity is the primary cause of these diseases. As it cannot be
  treated, sufferers must not have children.</p>

  <p>Character is abnormal in nervous disease.</p>

  <p>Marriage is very undesirable.</p>

  <p>As a parting injunction, whether you are an epileptic or a
  neurasthenic, or a friend, relative, or attendant of such a one:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
